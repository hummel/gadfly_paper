\begin{abstract}
 This paper describes the motivation for, and capabilities of, the open-source python library GADFLY.  The final manuscript will be similar in scope to the papers describing the yt project (Turk et al. 2011), and the astropy project (Robitaille et al. 2013), though more narrow in focus.  
The goal of this project is to leverage the capabilities of the broader python scientific computing ecosystem by providing a framework for analyzing simulation data from the astrophysical simulation code GADGET using pandas. Pandas is a thoroughly documented, open-source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and is quickly becoming the standard for data analysis in python.
