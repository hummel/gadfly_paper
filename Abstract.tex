\begin{abstract}
We present the first public release (v0.1) of the open-source \textsc{gadget} Dataframe Library: \code{gadfly}.
The goal of this project is to leverage the capabilities of the broader python scientific computing ecosystem by providing a framework for analyzing simulation data from the astrophysical simulation code GADGET using pandas. Pandas is a thoroughly documented, open-source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and is quickly becoming the standard for data analysis in python.
