\begin{abstract}
 This paper will fully describe the motivation for, and capabilities of, the open-source python code 'pyGadget' (https://github.com/hummel/pyGadget).  Any submitted manuscript would be similar in scope to the papers describing the yt project (ApJS, 2011, 192, 9), and the astropy project (A\&A, 2013, 558, 33), though more narrow in focus.  
The goal of this project is to leverage the capabilities of the broader python scientific computing ecosystem by providing a framework for analyzing simulation data from the astrophysical simulation code GADGET using pandas. Pandas is a thoroughly documented, open-source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and is quickly becoming the standard for data analysis in python.
