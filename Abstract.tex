\begin{abstract}
We present the first public release (v0.1) of the open-source \textsc{gadget} Dataframe Library: \code{gadfly}.The aim of this package is to leverage the capabilities of the broader python scientific computing ecosystem by providing tools for analyzing simulation data from the astrophysical simulation codes \textsc{gadget} and \textsc{gizmo} using \code{pandas}, a thoroughly documented, open-source library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures that is quickly becoming the standard for data analysis in python. 
\code{Gadfly} is a framework for analyzing particle-based simulation data stored in the HDF5 format using \code{pandas DataFrame}s. 
The package enables efficient memory management, includes utilities for unit handling, coordinate transformations, and parallel batch processing, and provides highly optimized routines for visualizing smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) datasets.
