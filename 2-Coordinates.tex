\subsection{Coordinate Transformations}
\label{sec:coords}
A full suite of coordinate transformation utilities is included in \code{gadfly}, with methods for converting between cartesian, spherical, and cylindrical coordinates, performing linear coordinate translations, and rotations about arbitrary axes.  
These methods are both directly accessible as independent library functions, and via the \code{PartType} dataframe object using the \verb|orient_box()| functionality.
