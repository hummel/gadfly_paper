\section{Future Development}
\label{future}
Before being released, code needs a configuration system.  None currently exists.  Code base also needs better documentation.  Actual future development could include ability to handle other particle based simulations outputs than just GADGET.  When the dask project finally stabilizes their out-of-core DataFrame functionality, moving from pandas to dask would allow for the analysis of large datasets on systems with limited memory.
