\section{A Framework built on pandas}
\label{framework}

The motivation for building an analysis framework on top of pandas is twofold.  Most importantly, doing so allows us to leverage existing capabilities of that library, and its strong developer community.  Second, using pandas.DataFrame as the primary data container rather than numpy arrays makes it much easier to keep different particle properties indexed correctly while still affording the flexibility to load and remove particle properties from memory at will.
