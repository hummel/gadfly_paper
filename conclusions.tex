\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}
In this paper we have presented the first public release of \code{gadfly}.  We have described the framework's structure, which is designed around three core abstractions: the \code{PartType} dataframe (Section \ref{sec:df}), the \code{Snapshot} object (Section \ref{sec:snap}), and the \code{Simulation} object (Section \ref{sec:sim}).
