\subsection{Units}
\label{sec:units}
\code{Gadfly} implements a minimal units-handling for converting between the native code units in which \textsc{gadget} stores data and the physical units of interest to astronomers.  
However, \textscs{gadget}'s code units may be modified to suit the problem at hand, an thus must be specified at \code{gadfly} initialization if they differ from the defaults listed in Table \ref{code_unit_defaults} below.
