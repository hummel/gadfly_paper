abstract = {Previous high-resolution cosmological simulations predicted that the first stars to appear in the early universe were very massive and formed in isolation. Here, we discuss a cosmological simulation in which the central 50 M(o) (where M(o) is the mass of the Sun) clump breaks up into two cores having a mass ratio of two to one, with one fragment collapsing to densities of 10(-8) grams per cubic centimeter. The second fragment, at a distance of approximately 800 astronomical units, is also optically thick to its own cooling radiation from molecular hydrogen lines but is still able to cool via collision-induced emission. The two dense peaks will continue to accrete from the surrounding cold gas reservoir over a period of approximately 10(5) years and will likely form a binary star system.},

abstract = {The properties of the first galaxies are shaped in large part by the first generations of stars, which emit high energy radiation and unleash both large amounts of mechanical energy and the first heavy elements when they explode as supernovae. We survey the theory of the formation of the first galaxies in this context, focusing on the results of cosmological simulations to illustrate a number of the key processes that define their properties. We first discuss the evolution of the primordial gas as it is incorporated into the earliest galaxies under the influence of the high energy radiation emitted by the earliest stars; we then turn to consider how the injection of heavy elements by the first supernovae transforms the evolution of the primordial gas and alters the character of the first galaxies. Finally, we discuss the prospects for the detection of the first galaxies by future observational missions, in particular focusing on the possibility that primordial star-forming galaxies may be uncovered.},

abstract = {We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 100,000 yr and 20 Gyr at a resolution of 3 A across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 A for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 A to 160 micron, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally-pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios abridged.},

abstract = {The observational signatures of the first cosmic explosions and their chemical imprint on second-generation stars both crucially depend on how heavy elements mix within the star at the earliest stages of the blast. We present numerical simulations of the early evolution of Population III (Pop III) pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) with the new adaptive mesh refinement code CASTRO. In stark contrast to 15-40 M sun core-collapse primordial supernovae, we find no mixing in most 150-250 M sun PISNe out to times well after breakout from the surface of the star. This may be the key to determining the mass of the progenitor of a primeval supernova, because vigorous mixing will cause emission lines from heavy metals such as Fe and Ni to appear much sooner in the light curves of core-collapse supernovae than in those of pair-instability explosions. Our models are consistent with observations of SN2007bi, the most likely PISN candidate found to date, which show that heavy elements in the interior of the SN are not mixed at all with helium in the outer envelope. Our results also imply that unlike low-mass Pop III supernovae, whose collective metal yields can be directly compared to the chemical abundances of extremely metal-poor stars, further detailed numerical simulations will be required to determine the nucleosynthetic imprint of very massive Pop III stars on their direct descendants.},

abstract = {We present results from high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of isolated Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)- and Milky-Way-sized galaxies that include a model for feedback from galactic cosmic rays (CRs). We find that CRs are naturally able to drive winds with mass loading factors of up to {\~{}}10 in dwarf systems. The scaling of the mass loading factor with circular velocity between the two simulated systems is consistent with $\backslash$eta $\backslash$propto v{\_}circ{\^{}}{\{}1-2{\}} required to reproduce the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function. In addition, simulations with CR feedback reproduce both the normalization and the slope of the observed trend of wind velocity with galaxy circular velocity. We find that winds in simulations with CR feedback exhibit qualitatively different properties compared to supernova-driven winds, where most of acceleration happens violently in situ near star forming sites. The CR-driven winds are accelerated gently by the large-scale pressure gradient established by CRs diffusing from the star-forming galaxy disk out into the halo. The CR-driven winds also exhibit much cooler temperatures and, in the SMC-sized system, warm (T {\~{}} 104 K) gas dominates the outflow. The prevalence of warm gas in such outflows may provide a clue as to the origin of ubiquitous warm gas in the gaseous halos of galaxies detected via absorption lines in quasar spectra.},

abstract = {Observations of high-redshift quasars at z ≳6 imply that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses M≳109 M were in place less than 1 Gyr after the big bang. If these SMBHs assembled from 'seed' BHs left behind by the first stars, then they must have accreted gas at close to the Eddington limit during a large fraction ({\textgreater}rsim 50 per cent) of the time. A generic problem with this scenario, however, is that the mass density in M ˜ 106 M⊙ SMBHs at z ˜ 6 already exceeds the locally observed SMBH mass density by several orders of magnitude; in order to avoid this overproduction, BH seed formation and growth must become significantly less efficient in less massive protogalaxies through some form of feedback, while proceeding unabated in the most massive galaxies that formed first. Using Monte Carlo realizations of the merger and growth history of BHs, we show that X-rays from the earliest accreting BHs can provide such a feedback mechanism, on a global scale. Our calculations paint a self-consistent picture of BH-made climate change, in which the first miniquasars - among them the ancestors of the z ˜ 6 quasar SMBHs - globally warm the intergalactic medium and suppress the formation and growth of subsequent generations of BHs. We present two specific models with global miniquasar feedback that provide excellent agreement with recent estimates of the z = 6 SMBH mass function. For each of these models, we estimate the rate of BH mergers at z {\textgreater} 6 that could be detected by the proposed gravitational-wave observatory eLISA/NGO.},

Modern large telescopes discovered galaxies at redshifts greater than seven, whereas theoretical studies have just reached the degree of sophistication necessary to make meaningful predictions. A crucial ingredient is the feedback exerted by the first generation of stars, through UV radiation, supernova blast waves, and chemical enrichment. The key goal is to derive the signature of the first galaxies to be observed with upcoming or planned next-generation facilities, such as the James Webb Space Telescope or Atacama Large Millimeter Array. From the observational side, ongoing deep-field searches for very high-redshift galaxies begin to provide us with empirical constraints on the nature of the first galaxies.},

abstract = {We assess supernova-driven pregalactic outflows as a mechanism for distributing the product of stellar nucleosynthesis over large cosmological volumes prior to the reionization epoch. Supernova (SN) ejecta will escape the grasp of halos with virial temperatures Tvir{\textgreater}{\~{}}104.3 K (corresponding to masses M{\textgreater}{\~{}}108 h-1 Msolar at redshift z=9 when they collapse from 2 $\sigma$ fluctuations) if rapid cooling can take place, and a significant fraction of their baryonic mass is converted into stars over a dynamical timescale. We study the evolution of SN-driven bubbles as they blow out from subgalactic halos and propagate into the intergalactic medium (IGM), and we show that to lift the halo gas out of the potential well, the energy injection must continue at least until blowaway occurs. If the fraction of ionizing photons that escape the dense sites of star formation into intergalactic space is greater than a few percent, pregalactic outflows will propagate into an IGM that has been prephotoionized by the same massive stars that later explode as SNe, and the expansion of the metal-enriched bubbles will be halted by the combined action of external pressure, gravity, and radiative losses. The collective explosive output of about 10,000 SNe per M{\textgreater}{\~{}}108 h-1 Msolar halo at these early epochs could pollute vast regions of intergalactic space to a mean metallicity {\textless}Z{\textgreater}=$\Omega$Z/$\Omega$b{\textgreater}{\~{}}0.003 (comparable to the levels observed in the Ly$\alpha$ forest at z{\~{}}3) without hydrodynamically perturbing the IGM much, i.e., producing large variations of the baryons relative to the dark matter. Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities between the dense shell that contains pristine swept-up material and the hot, metal-enriched, low-density bubble may contribute to the mixing and diffusion of heavy elements. The volume filling factor of the ejecta is higher than 20{\%} if the star formation efficiency is on the order of 10{\%}. Larger filling factors (not required by current observations) may be obtained for larger efficiencies, moderately top-heavy initial mass functions, halos for which a significant fraction of the gas is in a galactic disk and does not couple to the outflow (since matter is ejected perpendicularly to the disk), or from a population of more numerous sources-which would therefore have to originate from lower amplitude peaks. When the filling factor of the ejecta becomes significant, enriched material typically will be at a higher adiabat than expected from photoionization.},

abstract = {The cold dark matter model has become the leading theoretical picture for the formation of structure in the Universe. This model, together with the theory of cosmic inflation, makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a simulation of the growth of dark matter structure using 2,160(3) particles, following them from redshift z = 127 to the present in a cube-shaped region 2.230 billion lightyears on a side. In postprocessing, we also follow the formation and evolution of the galaxies and quasars. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with future generations of observational surveys of galaxies.},

abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard Cold Dark Matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fit over two decades in radius by scaling a simple ``universal'' profile. The characteristic overdensity of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way which reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii, but are significantly shallower than r -2 near the center and steeper than r -2 near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies.},

abstract = {Recent work suggests that the first generation of stars, the so-called Population III (Pop III), could have formed primarily in binaries or as members of small multiple systems. Here we investigate the impact of X-ray feedback from high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) left behind in stellar binary systems after the primary forms a black hole (BH), accreting gas at a high rate from the companion, a process that is thought to be favoured at the low metallicities characteristic of high-redshift gas. Thanks to their large mean free path, X-rays are capable of pre-ionizing and pre-heating the gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and in haloes long before the reionization of the Universe is complete, and thus could have strongly affected the formation of subsequent generations of stars as well as reionization. We have carried out zoomed hydrodynamical cosmological simulations of minihaloes, accounting for the formation of Pop III stars and their collapse into BHs and HMXBs, and the associated radiation-hydrodynamic feedback from ultraviolet and X-ray photons. We find no strong net feedback from HMXBs on the simulated star formation history. On the other hand, the pre-heating of the IGM by HMXBs leads to a strong suppression of small-scale structures and significantly lowers the recombination rate in the IGM, thus yielding a net positive feedback on reionization. We further show that X-ray feedback from HMXBs can augment the ionizing feedback from the Pop III progenitor stars to suppress gas accretion on to the first BHs, limiting their growth into supermassive BHs. Finally, we show that X-ray ionization by HMXBs leaves distinct signatures in the properties of the high-redshift hydrogen that may be probed in upcoming observations of the redshifted 21 cm spin-flip line.},

We study remnant black hole growth through accretion, including for the first time the radiation emitted due to accretion, with adaptive mesh refinement cosmological radiation-hydrodynamical simulations. The effects of photoionization and heating dramatically affect the large-scale inflow, resulting in negligible mass growth. We compare cases with accretion luminosity included and neglected to show that accretion radiation drastically changes the environment within 100 pc of the black hole, increasing gas temperatures by an order of magnitude. Gas densities are reduced and further star formation in the same minihalo is prevented for the 200 million years we followed. Without radiative feedback included most seed black holes do not gain mass as efficiently as has been hoped for in previous theories, implying that black hole remnants of population III stars in minihalos are not likely to be miniquasars. Most importantly, however, our calculations demonstrate that if these black holes are indeed accreting close to the Bondi-Hoyle rate with 10{\%} radiative efficiency they have a dramatic local effect in regulating star formation in the first galaxies. This suggests a novel mechanism for massive black hole formation—stellar-mass black holes may have suppressed fragmentation and star formation after falling into halos with virial temperatures {\~{}}104 K, facilitating massive black hole formation at their centers.},

abstract = {Cosmic rays (CRs) play a decisive role within our own Galaxy. They provide partial pressure support against gravity, they trace past energetic events such as supernovae, and they reveal the underlying structure of the baryonic matter distribution through their interactions. To study the impact of CRs on galaxy and cosmic structure formation and evolution, we develop an approximative framework for treating dynamical and radiative effects of CRs in cosmological simulations. Our guiding principle is to try to find a balance between capturing as many physical properties of CR populations as possible while at the same time requiring as little extra computational resources as possible. We approximate the CR spectrum of each fluid element by a single power-law, with spatially and temporally varying normalisation, low-energy cut-off, and spectral index. Principles of conservation of particle number, energy, and pressure are then used to derive evolution equations for the basic variables describing the CR spectrum, both due to adiabatic and non-adiabatic processes. The processes considered include compression and rarefaction, CR injection via shocks in supernova remnants, injection in structure formation shock waves, in-situ re-acceleration of CRs, CR spatial diffusion, CR energy losses due to Coulomb interactions, ionisation losses, Bremsstrahlung losses, and, finally, hadronic interactions with the background gas, including the associated $\gamma$-ray and radio emission due to subsequent pion decay. We show that the formalism reproduces CR energy densities, pressure, and cooling rates with an accuracy of ˜ 10{\%} in steady state conditions where CR injection balances cooling. It is therefore a promising formulation to allow simulations where CR physics is included. Finally, we briefly discuss how the formalism can be included in Lagrangian simulation methods such as the smoothed particle hydrodynamics technique. Our framework is therefore well suited to be included into numerical simulation schemes of galaxy and structure formation.},

abstract = {We study the clustering properties of the first galaxies formed in the universe. We find that, due to chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium by isolated Population III stars formed in mini-halos at redshift z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 30, the (chronologically) first galaxies are composed of metal-poor Population II stars and are highly clustered on small scales. In contrast, chemically pristine galaxies in halos with mass M {\~{}} 108 M sun may form at z {\textless} 20 in relatively underdense regions of the universe. This occurs once self-enrichment by Population III in mini-halos is quenched by the buildup of an H2 photodissociating radiative background in the Lyman-Werner bands. We find that these chemically pristine galaxies are spatially uncorrelated. Thus, we expect that deep fields with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) may detect clusters of chemically enriched galaxies but individual chemically pristine objects. We predict that metal-free galaxies at 10 {\textless}{\~{}} z {\textless}{\~{}} 15 have surface densities of about 80 arcmin-2 and per unit redshift but most of them will be too faint even for JWST. However, the predicted density makes these objects interesting targets for searches behind lensing clusters.},

Many new experiments measuring these particles, both directly in the atmosphere or space and indirectly via {\^{I}}³ rays and synchrotron radiation, have widened the range and quality of the information available on their origin, propagation, and interactions. The impact of low-energy cosmic rays on interstellar chemistry is a fast-developing topic, including the propagation of these particles into the clouds in which the chemistry occurs. Cosmic rays, via their {\^{I}}³-ray production, also provide a powerful way to probe the gas content of the interstellar medium. Substantial advances have been made in the observations and modelling of the interplay between cosmic rays and the interstellar medium. Focusing on energies up to 1 TeV, these interrelating aspects are covered at various levels of detail, giving a guide to the state of the subject.},

@article{PadovaniHennebelleGalli2013,
abstract = {Context. Cosmic rays play an important role in dense molecular cores, affecting their thermal and dynamical evolution and initiating the chemistry. Several studies have shown that the formation of protostellar discs in collapsing clouds is severely hampered by the braking torque exerted by the entrained magnetic field on the infalling gas, as long as the field remains frozen to the gas. Aims: In this paper we examine the possibility that the concentration and twisting of the field lines in the inner region of collapse can produce a significant reduction of the ionisation fraction. Methods: To check whether the cosmic-ray ionisation rate can fall below the critical value required to maintain good coupling, we first study the propagation of cosmic rays in a model of a static magnetised cloud varying the relative strength of the toroidal/poloidal components and the mass-to-flux ratio. We then follow the path of cosmic rays using realistic magnetic field configurations generated by numerical simulations of a rotating collapsing core with different initial conditions. Results: We find that an increment of the toroidal component of the magnetic field, or, in general, a more twisted configuration of the field lines, results in a decrease in the cosmic-ray flux. This is mainly due to the magnetic mirroring effect that is stronger where larger variations in the field direction are present. In particular, we find a decrease of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate below 10-18 s-1 in the central 300-400 AU, where density is higher than about 109 cm-3. This very low value of the ionisation rate is attained in the cases of intermediate and low magnetisation (mass-to-flux ratio $\lambda$ = 5 and 17, respectively) and for toroidal fields larger than about 40{\%} of the total field. Conclusions: Magnetic field effects can significantly reduce the ionisation fraction in collapsing clouds. We provide a handy fitting formula to compute approximately the attenuation of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate in a molecular cloud as a function of the density and the magnetic configuration.},

abstract = {We report results from numerical simulations of star formation in the early universe that focus on gas at very high densities and very low metallicities. We argue that the gas in the central regions of protogalactic halos will fragment as long as it carries sufficient angular momentum. Rotation leads to the build-up of massive disklike structures which fragment to form protostars. At metallicities Z{\~{}}10-5 Zsolar, dust cooling becomes effective and leads to a sudden drop of temperature at densities above n=1012 cm-3. This induces vigorous fragmentation, leading to a very densely packed cluster of low-mass stars. This is the first stellar cluster. The mass function of stars peaks below 1 Msolar, similar to what is found in the solar neighborhood and comparable to the masses of the very low metallicity subgiant stars recently discovered in the halo of our Milky Way. We find that even purely primordial gas can fragment at densities 1014cm-3{\textless}=n{\textless}=1016 cm-3, although the resulting mass function contains only a few objects (at least a factor of 10 fewer than the Z=10-5 Zsolar mass function) and is biased toward higher masses. A similar result is found for gas with Z=10-6 Zsolar. Gas with Z{\textless}=10-6 Zsolar behaves roughly isothermally at these densities (with polytropic exponent $\gamma${\~{}}1.06), and the massive disklike structures that form due to angular momentum conservation will be marginally unstable. As fragmentation is less efficient, we expect stars with Z{\textless}=10-6 Zsolar to be massive, with masses in excess of several tens of solar masses, consistent with the results from previous studies.},

abstract = {The thermal and chemical evolution of a collapsing spherical cloud composed of pure hydrogen gas is investigated. It is assumed that the cloud is in pressure-free collapse. Over a broad range of initial conditions, virtually all the gas is converted to molecular form by a density n = 10 to the 12th/cu cm. The reactions found to be most effective are the three-body ones: H + H + H yielding H2 + H; and H + H + H2 yielding 2H2. As a consequence of significant cooling from the molecules, the temperature rise is slowed, and the Jeans mass eventually falls below 0.1 solar mass for clouds less massive than 100 solar masses. Such clouds should thus be capable of fragmenting into low-mass stars. This conclusion is even more valid if angular momentum slows the collapse. Also included in a heuristic manner is the effect of shock heating from colliding fragments in a turbulent collapsing cloud. Owing to the early destruction of hydrogen molecules, the Jeans mass cannot drop as far with substantial heating.The primordial stellar mass spectrum may thus be a sensitive function of the degree and effectiveness of intercloud collisions.},

abstract = {The earliest generation of stars and black holes must have established an early `Lyman-Werner' background (LWB) at high redshift, prior to the epoch of reionization. Because of the long mean free path of photons with energies h$\nu$ {\textless} 13.6eV, the LWB was nearly uniform. However, some variation in the LWB is expected due to the discrete nature of the sources, and their highly clustered spatial distribution. In this paper, we compute the probability distribution function (PDF) of the LW flux that irradiates dark matter (DM) haloes collapsing at high redshift (z {\~{}} 10). Our model accounts for (i) the clustering of DM haloes, (ii) Poisson fluctuations in the number of corresponding star-forming galaxies and (iii) scatter in the LW luminosity produced by haloes of a given mass (calibrated using local observations). We find that {\textgreater}99 per cent of the DM haloes are illuminated by an LW flux within a factor of 2 of the global mean value. However, a small fraction, {\~{}}10-8 to 10-6, of DM haloes with virial temperatures Tvir {\textgreater}{\~{}} 104 K have a close luminous neighbour within {\textless}{\~{}}10 kpc, and are exposed to an LW flux exceeding the global mean by a factor of {\textgreater}20, or to J21,LW {\textgreater} 103 (in units of 10-21 erg s-1 Hz-1 sr-1 cm-2). This large LW flux can photodissociate H2 molecules in the gas collapsing due to atomic cooling in these haloes, and prevent its further cooling and fragmentation. Such close halo pairs therefore provide possible sites in which primordial gas clouds collapse directly into massive black holes (MBH {\~{}} 104-6Msolar), and subsequently grow into supermassive (MBH {\textgreater}{\~{}} 109Msolar) black holes by z {\~{}} 6.},

@article{Safranek-Shrader2010,
abstract = {Motivated by recent simulations of galaxy formation in which protogalaxies acquire their baryonic content through cold accretion, we study the gravitational fragmentation of cold streams flowing into a typical first galaxy. We use a one-zone hydrodynamical model to examine the thermal evolution of the gas flowing into a 108 M sun dark matter halo at redshift z = 10. The goal is to gain an understanding of the expected fragmentation mass scale and thus the characteristic mass of the first population of stars to form by shock fragmentation. Our model accurately describes the chemical and thermal evolution of the gas as we are specifically concerned with how the chemical abundances and initial conditions of the low-density, metal-enriched, cold accretion streams that pass an accretion shock alter the cooling properties and tendency to fragment in the post-shock gas. Cold accretion flows are not shock heated at the virial radius but instead flow along high-baryonic-density filaments of the cosmic web and penetrate deep into the host halo of the protogalaxy. In this physical regime, if molecular cooling is absent because of a strong Lyman-Werner background, we find there to be a sharp drop in the fragmentation mass at a metallicity of Z {\~{}} 10-4 Z sun. If, however, H2 and HD molecules are present, they dominate the cooling at T {\textless} 104 K, and metallicity then has no effect on the fragmentation properties of the cold stream. For a solar abundance pattern of metallicity, O is the most effective metal coolant throughout the evolution, while for a pair instability supernova (PISN) metallicity yield, Si+ is the most effective coolant. PISN abundance patterns also exhibit a slightly smaller critical metallicity. Dust grains are not included in our chemical model, but we argue that their inclusion would not significantly alter the results. We also find that this physical scenario allows for the formation of stellar clusters and large, 104 M sun bound fragments, possibly the precursors to globular clusters and supermassive black holes. Finally, we conclude that the usual assumption of isobaricity for galactic shocks breaks down in gas of a sufficiently high metallicity, suggesting that metal cooling leads to thermal instabilities.},

abstract = {At low temperatures, the main coolant in primordial gas is molecular hydrogen, H2. Recent work has shown that primordial gas that is not collapsing gravitationally but is cooling from an initially ionized state forms hydrogen deuteride, HD, in sufficient amounts to cool the gas to the temperature of the cosmic microwave background. This extra cooling can reduce the characteristic mass for gravitational fragmentation and may cause a shift in the characteristic masses of Population III stars. Motivated by the importance of the atomic and molecular data for the cosmological question, we assess several chemical and radiative processes that have hitherto been neglected: the sensitivity of the low-temperature H2 cooling rate to the ratio of ortho-H2 to para-H2, the uncertainty in the low-temperature cooling rate of H2 excited by collisions with atomic hydrogen, the effects of cooling from H2 excited by collisions with protons and electrons, and the large uncertainties in the rates of several of the reactions responsible for determining the H2 fraction in the gas. It is shown that the most important of neglected processes is the excitation of H2 by collisions with protons and electrons. Their effect is to cool the gas more rapidly at early times, and consequently to form less H2 and HD at late times. This fact, as well as several of the chemical uncertainties presented here, significantly affects the thermal evolution of the gas. We anticipate that this may lead to clear differences in future detailed three-dimensional studies of first structure formation. In such calculations it has previously been shown that the details of the timing between cooling and merger events decide between immediate runaway gravitational collapse and a slower collapse delayed by turbulent heating. Finally, we show that although the thermal evolution of the gas is in principle sensitive to the ortho-para ratio, in practice the standard assumption of a 3:1 ratio produces results that are almost indistinguishable from those produced by a more detailed treatment.},

abstract = {We present the case for developing a successor format for the immensely successful FITS format. We first review existing alternative formats and discuss why we do not believe they provide an adequate solution. The proposed format is called the Advanced Scientific Data Format (ASDF) and is based on an existing text format, YAML, that we believe removes most of the current problems with the FITS format. An overview of the capabilities of the new format is given along with specific examples. This format has the advantage that it does not limit the size of attribute names (akin to FITS keyword names) nor place restrictions on the size or type of values attributes have. Hierarchical relationships are explicit in the syntax and require no special conventions. Finally, it is capable of storing binary data within the file in its binary form. At its basic level, the format proposed has much greater applicability than for just astronomical data.},

abstract = {To constrain the nature of the very first stars, we investigate the collapse and fragmentation of primordial, metal-free gas clouds. We explore the physics of primordial star formation by means of three-dimensional simulations of the dark matter and gas components, using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, under a wide range of initial conditions, including the initial spin, the total mass of the halo, the redshift of virialization, the power spectrum of the DM fluctuations, the presence of HD cooling, and the number of particles employed in the simulation. We find characteristic values for the temperature, T{\~{}}a few 100 K, and the density, n{\~{}}103-104 cm-3, characterizing the gas at the end of the initial free-fall phase. These values are rather insensitive to the initial conditions. The corresponding Jeans mass is MJ{\~{}}103 Msolar. The existence of these characteristic values has a robust explanation in the microphysics of H2 cooling, connected to the minimum temperature that can be reached with the H2 coolant, and to the critical density at which the transition takes place between levels being populated according to non-LTE (NLTE), and according to LTE. In all cases, the gas dissipatively settles into an irregular, central configuration that has a filamentary and knotty appearance. The fluid regions with the highest densities are the first to undergo runaway collapse due to gravitational instability, and to form clumps with initial masses {\~{}}103 Msolar, close to the characteristic Jeans scale. These results suggest that the first stars might have been quite massive, possibly even very massive with M*{\textgreater}{\~{}}100 Msolar. After a gas element has undergone runaway collapse, and has reached densities in excess of 108 cm-3, a sink particle is created. This procedure allows us to follow the evolution of the overall system beyond the point where the first nonlinear region would otherwise force the calculation to a halt. These later evolutionary stages, during which the clumps grow in mass due to accretion and merging with other clumps, are quite sensitive to the initial conditions. The key process in building up very massive clumps, with masses up to a few times 104 Msolar, is merging between clumps. Since the merging rate sensitively depends on the density of the gas, halos with the highest degree of central concentration are able to assemble the most massive clumps. Among these are halos with a low spin ($\lambda${\~{}}=0.01), and with DM fluctuations imprinted according to a white-noise spectrum.},

The appearance of the first generation of stars (Pop III) in the Universe represents a critical point during cosmic evolution signaling the end of the dark ages, a period of absence of light sources. Despite their importance, there is no confirmed detection of Pop III stars so far. A fraction of these primordial stars are expected to die as pair-instability supernovae (PISN), and should be bright enough to be observed up to a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. While the quest for Pop III stars continues, detailed theoretical models and computer simulations serve as a testbed for their observability. With the upcoming near-infrared missions, estimates of the feasibility of detecting PISN are not only timely but imperative. To address this problem, we combine state of art cosmological and radiative simulations into a complete and self-consistent framework which includes detailed features of the observational process.

abstract = {Current and upcoming cosmological observations allow us to probe structures on smaller and smaller scales, entering highly nonlinear regimes. In order to obtain theoretical predictions in these regimes, large cosmological simulations have to be carried out. The promised high accuracy from observations make the simulation task very demanding: the simulations have to be at least as accurate as the observations. This requirement can only be fulfilled by carrying out an extensive code validation program. The first step of such a program is the comparison of different cosmology codes including gravitation interactions only. In this paper we extend a recently carried out code comparison project to include five more simulation codes. We restrict our analysis to a small cosmological volume which allows us to investigate properties of halos. For the matter power spectrum and the mass function, the previous results hold, with the codes agreeing at the 10{\%} level over wide dynamic ranges. We extend our analysis to the comparison of halo profiles and investigate the halo count as a function of local density. We introduce and discuss ParaView as a flexible analysis tool for cosmological simulations, the use of which immensely simplifies the code comparison task.},

We present detailed cosmological simulations with sufficient resolution both to model the relevant physical processes and to directly assess the impact of stellar feedback on observable properties of dwarf galaxies. We show that feedback drives large-scale, bulk motions of the interstellar gas, resulting in substantial gravitational potential fluctuations and a consequent reduction in the central matter density, bringing the theoretical predictions in agreement with observations.},

abstract = {The chemical abundance patterns observed in metal-poor Galactic halo stars contain the signature of the first supernovae, and thus allow us to probe the first stars that formed in the universe. We construct a theoretical model for the early chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way, aiming in particular at the contribution from pair-instability supernovae (PISNe). These are a natural consequence of current theoretical models for primordial star formation at the highest masses. However, no metal-poor star displaying the distinct PISN signature has yet been observed. We here argue that this apparent absence of any PISN signature is due to an observational selection effect. Whereas most surveys traditionally focus on the most metal-poor stars, we predict that early PISN enrichment tends to ``overshoot,'' reaching enrichment levels of [Ca/H]{\~{}}=-2.5 that would be missed by current searches. We utilize existing observational data to place constraints on the primordial initial mass function (IMF). The number fraction of PISNe in the primordial stellar population is estimated to be {\textless}0.07, or {\textless}{\~{}}40{\%} by mass, assuming that metal-free stars have masses in excess of 10 Msolar. We further predict, based on theoretical estimates for the relative number of PISNe, that the expected fraction of second-generation stars below [Ca/H]=-2 with a dominant (i.e., {\textgreater}90{\%}) contribution from PISNe is merely {\~{}}10-4 to 5×10-4. The corresponding fraction of stars formed from gas exclusively enriched by PISNe is a factor of {\~{}}4 smaller.

Our simulation takes into account processes previously neglected such as free-free interactions with ions and recombinations, and uses the best available cross-sections for collisional ionizations and excitations with H and He and for electron-electron collisions. We precisely derive the fraction of the primary electron energy that heats the gas, ionizes atoms and produces line and continuum photons as a function of the ionization fraction. Handy fitting formulae for all the above energy depositions are provided. By keeping track of the individual photons, we can distinguish between photons in the Ly$\alpha$ resonance and those with energy E {\textless} 10.2 eV that do not interact further with gas. This separation is important because a Ly$\alpha$ background can heat or cool the gas depending on the nature of the photons, and can have effects on the 21-cm radiation emitted by neutral H, which will probably become detectable at z {\textgreater} 6 in the near future by the next generation radio interferometers.},

Protostellar dust heating has a negligible effect on the star formation efficiency, at least during the early evolutionary stages, but it moderately suppresses gaseous fragmentation and brown dwarf formation.

From these, we derive $\sigma$8 = 0.812 ± 0.026, H 0 = 70.5 ± 1.3 km s-1 Mpc-1, $\Omega$ b = 0.0456 ± 0.0015, $\Omega$ c = 0.228 ± 0.013, $\Omega$ m h 2 = 0.1358+0.0037 -0.0036, z reion = 10.9 ± 1.4, and t 0 = 13.72 ± 0.12 Gyr. With the WMAP data combined with BAO and SN, we find the limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r {\textless} 0.22(95{\%}CL), and that ns {\textgreater} 1 is disfavored even when gravitational waves are included, which constrains the models of inflation that can produce significant gravitational waves, such as chaotic or power-law inflation models, or a blue spectrum, such as hybrid inflation models. We obtain tight, simultaneous limits on the (constant) equation of state of dark energy and the spatial curvature of the universe: -0.14 {\textless} 1 + w {\textless} 0.12(95{\%}CL) and -0.0179 {\textless} $\Omega$ k {\textless} 0.0081(95{\%}CL). We provide a set of "WMAP distance priors," to test a variety of dark energy models with spatial curvature. We test a time-dependent w with a present value constrained as -0.33 {\textless} 1 + w 0 {\textless} 0.21 (95{\%} CL). Temperature and dark matter fluctuations are found to obey the adiabatic relation to within 8.9{\%} and 2.1{\%} for the axion-type and curvaton-type dark matter, respectively. The power spectra of TB and EB correlations constrain a parity-violating interaction, which rotates the polarization angle and converts E to B. The polarization angle could not be rotated more than -5fdg9 {\textless} $\Delta$$\alpha$ {\textless} 2fdg4 (95{\%} CL) between the decoupling and the present epoch. We find the limit on the total mass of massive neutrinos of ∑m $\nu$ {\textless} 0.67 eV(95{\%}CL), which is free from the uncertainty in the normalization of the large-scale structure data. The number of relativistic degrees of freedom (dof), expressed in units of the effective number of neutrino species, is constrained as N eff = 4.4 ± 1.5 (68{\%}), consistent with the standard value of 3.04. Finally, quantitative limits on physically-motivated primordial non-Gaussianity parameters are -9 {\textless} f local NL {\textless} 111 (95{\%} CL) and -151 {\textless} f equil NL {\textless} 253 (95{\%} CL) for the local and equilateral models, respectively.

abstract = {We use cosmological simulations of high-redshift minihaloes to investigate the effect of dark matter annihilation (DMA) on the collapse of primordial gas. We numerically investigate the evolution of the gas as it assembles in a Population III stellar disc. We find that when DMA effects are neglected, the disc undergoes multiple fragmentation events beginning at ˜500 yr after the appearance of the first protostar. On the other hand, DMA heating and ionization of the gas speeds the initial collapse of gas to protostellar densities and also affects the stability of the developing disc against fragmentation, depending on the DM distribution. We compare the evolution when we model the DM density with an analytical DM profile which remains centrally peaked, and when we simulate the DM profile using N-body particles (the `live' DM halo). When utilizing the analytical DM profile, DMA suppresses disc fragmentation for ˜3500 yr after the first protostar forms, in agreement with earlier work. However, when using a `live' DM halo, the central DM density peak is gradually flattened due to the mutual interaction between the DM and the rotating gaseous disc, reducing the effects of DMA on the gas, and enabling secondary protostars of mass ˜1 M⊙ to be formed within ˜900 yr. These simulations demonstrate that DMA is ineffective in suppressing gas collapse and subsequent fragmentation, rendering the formation of long-lived dark stars unlikely. However, DMA effects may still be significant in the early collapse and disc formation phase of primordial gas evolution.},

abstract = {Galaxies form in hierarchically assembling dark matter halos. With cosmological three-dimensional adaptive mesh refinement simulations, we explore in detail the virialization of baryons in the concordance cosmology, including optically thin primordial gas cooling. We focus on early protogalaxies with virial temperatures of 104 K and their progenitors. Without cooling, virial heating occurs in shocks close to the virial radius for material falling in from voids. Material in dense filaments penetrates deeper to about half that radius. With cooling, the virial shock position shrinks, and the filaments reach scales as small as a third the virial radius. The temperatures in protogalaxies found in adiabatic simulations decrease by a factor of 2 from the center and show flat entropy cores. In cooling halos, the gas reaches virial equilibrium with the dark matter potential through its turbulent velocities. We observe turbulent Mach numbers ranging from 1 to 3 in the cooling cases. This turbulence is driven by the large scale merging and, interestingly, remains supersonic in the centers of these early galaxies, even in the absence of any feedback processes. The virial theorem is shown to approximately hold over 3 orders of magnitude in length scale, with the turbulent pressure prevailing over the thermal energy. The turbulent velocity distributions are Maxwellian and by far dominate the small rotation velocities associated with the total angular momentum of the galaxies. Decomposing the velocity field using the Cauchy-Stokes theorem, we show that ample amounts of vorticity are present around shocks even at the very centers of these objects. In the cold flow regime of galaxy formation for halo masses below 1012 Msolar, this dominant role of virialization-driven turbulence should play an important role in star formation, as well as the build up of early magnetic fields.},

abstract = {We study the evolution of supernova (SN) remnants of the first stars, taking proper account of the radiative feedback of the progenitor stars on the surroundings. We carry out a series of one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with radiative cooling, starting from initial configurations that are drawn from the results of our earlier radiation hydrodynamic simulations of the first H II regions. We primarily consider explosion energies ESN=1051-1053 ergs, appropriate for various types of single Population III supernovae, and also explore cases with greater energy to model multiple explosions. In low-mass ({\textless}{\~{}}106 Msolar) halos, the stellar radiation significantly reduces the ambient gas density prior to the SN explosion. The blast wave quickly propagates over the halo's virial radius, leading to complete evacuation of the gas even with an input energy of 1050 ergs. We find that a large fraction of the remnant's thermal energy is lost in 105-107 yr by line cooling, whereas for larger explosion energies, the remnant expands even more rapidly with decreasing interior density and cools predominantly via the inverse Compton process, adding the bulk of the energy to cosmic microwave background photons. In higher mass ({\~{}}107 Msolar) halos, the gas density near the explosion site remains high ({\textgreater}{\~{}}104 cm-3), and the SN shock is heavily confined; the thermal energy of the remnant is quickly radiated away by free-free emission, even if the total input energy exceeds the binding energy of halos by 2 orders of magnitude. We show that the efficiency of halo destruction is determined not only by the explosion energy but also by the gas density profile and thus is controlled by radiative feedback prior to the explosion. We compute the emissivity of the remnants in various energy ranges and examine their detectability by future observations. Several implications of our results for the formation of the first quasars and second-generation stars in the universe are also discussed.},

Based on the concept of turbulent diffusion, we link the diffusivity of a pollutant to the local physical conditions and can thus resolve mixing in space and time. We apply our prescription to the evolution of an idealized supernova remnant and find that we can model the distribution of heavy elements without having to explicitly resolve hydrodynamic instabilities in the post-shock gas. Instead, the dispersal of the pollutant is implicitly modelled through its dependence on the local velocity dispersion. Our method can thus be used in any SPH simulation that investigates chemical mixing but lacks the necessary resolution on small scales.

abstract = {Theoretical models predict the supernova explosions ending the lives of some of the first stars to have been extremely energetic pair-instability supernovae (PISNe). With energies approaching 10{\^{}}53 ergs, these supernovae are expected to be within the detection limits of the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), allowing observational constraints to be placed on the properties of the first stars. We estimate the source density of PISNe using a semi-analytic halo mass function based approach, accounting for the effects of feedback from star formation on the PISN rate using cosmological simulations. We estimate an upper limit of {\~{}}2 PISNe per JWST field of view at any given time. Feedback can reduce this rate significantly, e.g., lowering it to approximately one PISN visible per 2.5 JWST fields of view. We also find that the main obstacle to observing PISNe from the first stars is their scarcity, not their faintness; exposures longer than a few times 10{\^{}}4 s will do little to increase the number of PISNe found. Given this we suggest a mosaic style search strategy for detecting PISNe from the first stars as even rather high redshift PISNe are unlikely to be missed by moderate exposures, and a large number of pointings will be required to ensure a detection. For an observing program totalling 10{\^{}}6 s, the probability of a detection is maximized by dividing the campaign into {\~{}}150 individual fields with {\~{}}5000 s exposure in each.},

abstract = {We study cosmological simulations of early structure formation, including non-equilibrium molecular chemistry, metal pollution from stellar evolution, transition from Population III (PopIII) to Population II (PopII) star formation, regulated by a given critical metallicity, and feedback effects. We perform analyses of the properties of the gas, and use the PopIII and PopII populations as tracers of the metallicity. This allows us to investigate the properties of early metal spreading from the different stellar populations and its interplay with pristine molecular gas, in terms of the initial mass function and critical metallicity. We find that, independently of the details about PopIII modelling, after the onset of star formation, regions enriched below the critical level are mostly found in isolated environments, while PopII star formation regions are much more clumped. Typical star-forming haloes, at z˜ 15-10, with masses between ˜107 and 108 Msun, show average supernova (SN) driven outflow rates of up to ˜10-4 Msun yr-1 in enriched gas, initially leaving the original star formation regions almost devoid of metals. The polluted material, which is gravitationally incorporated in overdense environments on time-scales of ˜107 yr, is mostly coming from external, nearby star-forming sites ('gravitational enrichment'). In parallel, the pristine-gas inflow rates are some orders of magnitudes larger, between ˜10-3 and 10-1 Msun yr-1. However, thermal feedback from SN destroys molecules within the pristine gas hindering its ability to cool and to condense into high-density star-forming regions. Only the polluted material incorporated via gravitational enrichment can continue to cool by atomic fine-structure transitions on short time-scales, short enough to end the initial PopIII regime within less than 108 yr. Moreover, the interplay between the pristine, cold, infalling gas and the ejected, hot, metal-rich gas leads to turbulent Reynolds numbers of the order of ˜108-1010, and contributes to the suppression of pristine inflow rates into the densest, star-forming regions.},

However, without CR irradiation, even weak far ultra-violet (FUV) irradiation suppresses HD formation/cooling. Here, we examine conditions for HD cooling in primordial clouds including both FUV and CR feedback. At the beginning of collapse, the shock-compressed gas cools with its density increasing, while the relic HII region gas cools at a constant density. Moreover, shocks tend to occur in denser environments than HII regions. Owing to the higher column density and the more effective shielding, the critical FUV intensity for HD cooling in a shock-compressed gas becomes {\$}\backslashsim 10{\$} times higher than in relic HII regions. Consequently, in the shock-compressed gas, the critical FUV intensity exceeds the background level for most of the redshift we consider ({\$}6 \backslashlesssim z \backslashlesssim 15{\$}), while in relic HII regions, HD cooling becomes effective after the CR intensity increases enough at {\$}z \backslashlesssim 10{\$}.

abstract = {The first stars in the universe formed out of pristine primordial gas clouds that were radiatively cooled to a few hundreds of degrees kelvin either via molecular or atomic (Lyman-$\alpha$) hydrogen lines. This primordial mode of star formation was eventually quenched once radiative and/or chemical (metal enrichment) feedbacks marked the transition to Population II stars. In this paper, we present a model for the formation rate of Population III stars based on Press-Schechter modeling coupled with analytical recipes for gas cooling and radiative feedback. Our model also includes a novel treatment for metal pollution based on self-enrichment due to a previous episode of Population III star formation in progenitor halos. With this model, we derive the star formation history of Population III stars, their contribution to the reionization of the universe and the time of the transition from Population III star formation in minihalos (M ≈ 106 M sun, cooled via molecular hydrogen) to that in more massive halos (M gsim 2 × 107 M sun, where atomic hydrogen cooling is also possible). We consider a grid of models highlighting the impact of varying the values for the free parameters used, such as star formation and feedback efficiency. The most critical factor is the assumption that only one Population III star is formed in a halo. In this scenario, metal-free stars contribute only to a minor fraction of the total number of photons required to reionize the universe. In addition, metal-free star formation is primarily located in minihalos, and chemically enriched halos become the dominant locus of star formation very early in the life of the universe—at redshift z ≈ 25—even assuming a modest fraction (0.5{\%}) of enriched gas converted in stars. If instead multiple metal-free stars are allowed to form out of a single halo, then there is an overall boost of Population III star formation, with a consequent significant contribution to the reionizing radiation budget. In addition, the bulk of metal-free stars are produced in halos with M gsim 2 × 107 M sun.},

abstract = {We derive the effects of dark matter (DM) decays and annihilations on structure formation. We consider moderately massive DM particles (sterile neutrinos and light DM), as they are expected to give the maximum contribution to heating and reionization. The energy injection from DM decays and annihilations produces both an enhancement in the abundance of coolants (H2 and HD) and an increase of gas temperature. We find that for all the considered DM models the critical halo mass for collapse, mcrit, is generally higher than in the unperturbed case. However, the variation of mcrit is small. In the most extreme cases, that is, considering light DM annihilations (decays) and haloes virializing at redshift zvir {\textgreater} 30 (zvir {\~{}} 10), mcrit increases by a factor of {\~{}}4 ({\~{}}2). In the case of annihilations the variations of mcrit are also sensitive to the assumed profile of the DM halo. Furthermore, we note that the fraction of gas which is retained inside the halo can be substantially reduced (to {\~{}}40 per cent of the cosmic value), especially in the smallest haloes, as a consequence of the energy injection by DM decays and annihilations.},

abstract = {Direct collapse black holes (DCBH) have been proposed as a solution to the challenge of assembling supermassive black holes by z {\textgreater} 6 to explain the bright quasars observed at this epoch. The formation of a DCBH seed with M{\_}{\{}BH{\}}˜ 10{\^{}}{\{}4-5{\}} M{\_}{\{}⊙{\}} requires a pristine atomic-cooling halo to be illuminated by an external radiation field that is sufficiently strong to entirely suppress H2 cooling in the halo. Many previous studies have attempted to constrain the critical specific intensity that is likely required to suppress H2 cooling, denoted as Jcrit. However, these studies have typically assumed that the incident external radiation field can be modeled with a black-body spectrum. Under this assumption, it is possible to derive a unique value for Jcrit that depends only on the temperature of the black-body. In this study we consider a more realistic spectral energy distribution (SED) for the external source of radiation that depends entirely on its star formation history and age. The rate of destruction of the species responsible for suppressing molecular hydrogen cooling depends on the detailed shape of the SED. Therefore the value of Jcrit is tied to the shape of the incident SED of the neighbouring galaxy. We fit a parametric form to the rates of destruction of H2 and H- that permit direct collapse. Owing to this, we find that Jcrit is not a fixed threshold but can lie anywhere in the range Jcrit ˜ 0.5-103, depending on the details of the source stellar population.},

abstract = {The birth and death of the first generation of stars have important implications for the thermal state and chemical properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the early universe. Sometime after recombination, the neutral chemically pristine gas was reionized by ultraviolet photons emitted from the first stars but was also enriched with heavy elements when these stars ended their lives as energetic supernovae. Using the results from previous high-resolution cosmological simulations of early structure formation that include radiative transfer, we show that a significant volume fraction of the IGM can be metal polluted, as well as ionized, by massive Population III stars formed in small-mass ({\~{}}106-107 Msolar) halos early on. If most of the early generation stars die as pair-instability supernovae with energies up to {\~{}}1053 ergs, the volume-averaged mean metallicity will quickly reach Z{\~{}}10-4 Zsolar by a redshift of {\~{}}15-20, possibly causing a transition to the formation of a stellar population that is dominated by low-mass stars. In this scenario, the early chemical enrichment history should closely trace the reionization history of the IGM, and the end of the Population III era is marked by the completion of reionization and preenrichment by z{\~{}}15. We conclude that, while the preenrichment may partially account for the ``metallicity floor'' in high-redshift Ly$\alpha$ clouds, it does not significantly affect the elemental abundance in the intracluster medium.},

abstract = {Energy released by a small fraction of the baryons in the Universe, which condensed out while the intergalactic medium (IGM) was cold, dark and neutral, reheated and reionized it by redshift 6, exposing other baryons already condensed into dwarf-galaxy minihaloes to the glare of ionizing radiation. We present the first gas dynamical simulations of the photoevaporation of cosmological minihaloes overtaken by the ionization fronts which swept through the IGM during the reionization epoch in the currently favoured $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) universe, including the effects of radiative transfer. These simulations demonstrate the phenomenon of I-front trapping inside minihaloes, in which the weak, R-type fronts which travelled supersonically across the IGM decelerated when they encountered the dense, neutral gas inside minihaloes, and were thereby transformed into D-type I-fronts, preceded by shock waves. For a minihalo with virial temperature below 104 K, the I-front gradually burned its way through the minihalo which trapped it, removing all of its baryonic gas by causing a supersonic, evaporative wind to blow backwards into the IGM, away from the exposed layers of minihalo gas just behind the advancing I-front. We describe this process in detail, along with some of its observable consequences, for the illustrative case of a minihalo of total mass 107 Msolar, exposed to a distant source of ionizing radiation with either a stellar or quasar-like spectrum, after it was overtaken at redshift z= 9 by the weak, R-type I-front which ionized the IGM surrounding the source. For a source at z= 9 which emits 1056 ionizing photons per second at 1 Mpc (or, equivalently, 1052 ionizing photons per second at 10 kpc), the photoevaporation of this minihalo takes about 100-150 Myr, depending on the source spectrum, ending at about z= 7.5. Such hitherto neglected feedback effects were widespread during the reionization epoch. N-body simulations and analytical estimates of halo formation in the $\Lambda$CDM model suggest that sub-kpc minihaloes such as these, with virial temperatures below 104 K, were so common as to cover the sky around larger-mass source haloes and possibly dominate the absorption of ionizing photons during reionization. This means that previous estimates of the number of ionizing photons per hydrogen atom required to complete reionization which neglected this effect may be too low. Regardless of their effect on the progress of reionization, however, the minihaloes were so abundant that random lines of sight through the high-z Universe should encounter many of them, which suggests that it may be possible to observe the processes described here in the absorption spectra of distant sources.},

abstract = {The collapse of dense cores with metallicities 0-1 Z sun is studied by hydrodynamical calculations coupled with detailed chemical and radiative processes. For this purpose, we construct a simple chemical network with non-equilibrium reactions among 15 chemical species, H+, e, H, H2, D+, D, HD, C+, C, CO, CO2, O, OH, H2O, and O2, which reproduces the abundance of important molecular coolants given by a more detailed network very well. Starting from the initial density of 104 cm-3, the evolution is followed until the formation of a hydrostatic protostar at the center {\~{}}1021 cm-3. In a lower-metallicity gas cloud, the temperature during the collapse remains high owing to less efficient cooling. After the cloud core becomes optically thick to the thermal emission by dust, temperature evolution at the center converges to a single trajectory, except for cases with metallicity {\textless}=10-6 Z sun, where the temperature remains slightly higher than in higher-metallicity cases even after becoming optically thick to thermal radiation by the H2 collision-induced emission. The protostellar masses at their formation are a few 10-3 M sun, being slightly higher for cases with {\textless}=10-6 Z sun. Using the temperature evolution at the center as a function the density, we discuss the possibility of fragmentation during the dust-cooling phase. The critical metallicity for the fragmentation is 10-5 Z sun assuming moderate elongation of the cloud cores at the onset of this phase. From the density and velocity distributions at the time of protostar formation, we evaluate the mass accretion rate in the subsequent accretion phase. The accretion rate is larger than the Shu accretion rate for the inside-out collapse from an initially static cloud simec 3 s/G, where c s is the sound speed in the prestellar gas, by about a factor of 10 owing to more dynamical nature of the collapse. Using these accretion rates, we also calculate the evolution of the protostars under the assumption of stationary accretion flow. For {\textgreater}=10-4 Z sun, we succeed in following their evolution well after the arrival to the main-sequence phase. For lower-metallicity cases, however, owing to too high accretion rates {\textgreater}{\~{}} a few 10-3 M sun yr-1, the total luminosity, which consists of contribution from accretion and internal luminosity, reaches the Eddington limit, thereby rendering the stationary accretion impossible for gsim100 M sun. Finally, we discuss the possible suppression of fragmentation by heating of the ambient gas by protostellar radiation, which is considered important in the contemporary star formation. We argue that it is negligible for {\textless}10-2 Z sun.},

@article{Mirabeletal2011,
abstract = {Context. It is well established that between 380 000 and 1 billion years after the Big Bang the Inter Galactic Medium (IGM) underwent a "phase transformation" from cold and fully neutral to warm (≈ 104 K) and ionized. Whether this phase transformation was fully driven and completed by photoionization by young hot stars is a question of topical interest in cosmology. Aims: We propose here that besides the ultraviolet radiation from massive stars, feedback from accreting black holes in high-mass X-ray binaries (BH-HMXBs) was an additional, important source of heating and reionization of the IGM in regions of low gas density at large distances from star-forming galaxies. Methods: We use current theoretical models on the formation and evolution of primitive massive stars of low metallicity, and the observations of compact stellar remnants in the near and distant universe, to infer that a significant fraction of the first generations of massive stars end up as BH-HMXBs. Results: The total number of energetic ionizing photons from an accreting stellar black hole in an HMXB is comparable to the total number of ionizing photons of its progenitor star. However, the X-ray photons emitted by the accreting black hole are capable of producing several secondary ionizations and the ionizing power of the resulting black hole could be greater than that of its progenitor. Feedback by the large populations of BH-HMXBs heats the IGM to temperatures of ≈ 104 K and maintains it ionized on large distance scales. Conclusions: BH-HMXBs determine the early thermal history of the universe and maintain it as ionized over large volumes of space in regions of low density. This has a direct impact on the properties of the faintest galaxies at high redshifts, the smallest dwarf galaxies in the local universe, and on the existing and future surveys at radio wavelengths of atomic hydrogen in the early universe.},

abstract = {This article first reviews the basic physics of rotating stars and their evolution. The changes of the mechanical and thermal equilibrium of rotating stars are examined. An important, predicted and observed, effect is that rotating stars are hotter at the poles and cooler at the equator. The mass loss by stellar winds, which are influenced by the anisotropic temperature distribution, is discussed. These anisotropies in the interior are also driving circulation currents, which transports the chemical elements and the angular momentum in stars. Internal differential rotation, if present, creates instabilities and mixing, in particular, the shear mixing, the horizontal turbulence and their interactions. A major check of the model predictions concerns the changes of the surface abundances, which are modified by mass loss in the very massive stars and by rotational mixing in O-type and B-type stars. The observations are shown to confirm the existence of rotational mixing, with much larger effects at lower metallicities. The predictions of stellar models concerning the evolution of the surface velocities, the evolutionary tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and lifetimes, the populations of blue, red supergiants and Wolf-Rayet stars, and the progenitors of type Ibc supernovae are discussed. In many aspects, rotating models are shown to provide a much better fit than nonrotating ones. Using the same physical ingredients as those which fit the best observations of stars at near solar metallicities, the consequences of rotating models for the status of Be stars, the progenitors of gamma ray bursts, the evolution of Pop III stars and of very metal-poor stars, the early chemical evolution of galaxies, the origin of the C-enhanced metal poor stars and of the chemical anomalies in globular clusters are explored. Rotation together with mass loss are two key physical ingredients shaping the evolution of massive stars during the whole cosmic history.},

abstract = {In hierarchical models of structure formation, an early cosmic UV background (UVB) is produced by the small (Tvir{\textless}{\~{}}104 K) halos that collapse before reionization. The UVB at energies below 13.6 eV suppresses the formation of stars or black holes inside small halos by photodissociating their only cooling agent, molecular H2. We self-consistently compute the buildup of the early UVB in Press-Schechter models, coupled with H2 photodissociation both in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and inside virialized halos. We find that the intergalactic H2 has a negligible effect on the UVB, both because its initial optical depth is small ({\textless}{\~{}}0.1) and because it is photodissociated at an early stage. If the UV sources in the first collapsed halos are stars, then their UV flux suppresses further star formation inside small halos. This results in a pause in the buildup of the UVB, and reionization is delayed until larger halos (Tvir{\textgreater}{\~{}}104 K) collapse. If the small halos host miniquasars with hard spectra extending to {\~{}}1 keV, then their X-rays balance the effects of the UVB, the negative feedback does not occur, and reionization could be caused by the small halos.},

abstract = {The chemistry of deuterium, as well as that of hydrogen and helium, in the postrecombination era of the expanding early universe is presented. A thorough survey of all potentially important gas-phase reactions involving the primordial elements produced in the Big Bang, with a particular emphasis on deuterium, is given. The reaction set, consisting of 144 processes, is used in a nonequilibrium chemistry model to follow the production of primordial molecules in the postrecombination era. It is found that significant deuterium fractionation occurs for HD+, HD, and H2D+, while the abundance of D+ is reduced compared to the proton abundance. Even with the enhanced fractionation of H2D+, its abundance is predicted to be too small to cause any interesting cosmological consequences, such as possible attenuation of spatial anisotropies in the cosmic background radiation field, detections of the epochs of reionization and reheating, or constraints on the primordial deuterium abundance. HD, being the second most abundant primordial molecule after H2, may play a role in subsequent structure formation because of its cooling radiation.},

Observational results on all phases of the interstellar medium are summarized, various local phenomena occurring in the gas and in dust grains are discussed, and elastic collisions are studied in detail. Those interactions of the gas with radiation that can be understood without any detailed analysis of excitation conditions are examined and then treated on the basis of the steady-state equation, which is also used to analyze ionization, dissociation, and gas heating. The optical properties of grains and corresponding results for grain radii, composition, and mean density are presented; results of optical polarization studies and an alignment analysis are also reported. The theory of such grain properties as electric charge, temperature, radiative acceleration, and likely evolution is considered. The overall equilibrium and dynamics of the interstellar gas are investigated, including explosions of H II regions and supernova shells as well as processes of star formation.},

Molecular hydrogen densities in the range from 100 to 1 million per cu cm and kinetic temperatures between 10 and 60 K are considered, radiative transfer is calculated on the basis of the velocity-gradient model, and best estimates of the fractional abundance of species important for cooling are used to construct total cooling curves at each kinetic temperature. The contributions of several possible heating sources are evaluated, including heating by cosmic rays, H2 formation on grains, gravitational contraction, collisions with warm dust grains, and magnetic ion-neutral slip. Rates for each process are derived and equated with the cooling rate to obtain equilibrium temperature-density relations in a number of cases.

We analyse the correlation between early PopIII stars and LGRBs by using cosmological N-body/hydrodynamical simulations, which include detailed chemical evolution, cooling, star formation, feedback effects and the transition between PopIII and more standard Population I/II (PopII/I) stars. From the Swift observed rate of LGRBs, we estimate the fraction of black holes that will produce a GRB from PopII/I stars to be in the range 0.028 {\textless} fGRB {\textless} 0.140, depending on the assumed upper metallicity of the progenitor. Assuming that as of today no GRB event has been associated with a PopIII star, we estimate the upper limit for the fraction of LGRBs produced by PopIII stars to be in the range 0.006 {\textless} fGRB {\textless} 0.022. When we apply a detection threshold compatible with the BAT instrument, we find that the expected fraction of PopIII GRBs (GRB3) is ˜10 per cent of the full LGRB population at z {\textgreater} 6, becoming as high as 40 per cent at z {\textgreater} 10. Finally, we study the properties of the galaxies hosting our sample of GRB3s. We find that the average metallicity of the galaxies hosting a GRB3 is typically higher than the critical metallicity used to select the PopIII stars, due to the efficiency in polluting the gas above such low values. We also find that the highest probability of finding a GRB3 occurs within galaxies with a stellar mass {\textless}107 Msun, independent of the redshift.},

abstract = {We report results from numerical simulations of star formation in the early universe that focus on the dynamical behavior of metal-free gas under different initial and environmental conditions. In particular we investigate the role of turbulence, which is thought to ubiquitously accompany the collapse of high-redshift halos. We distinguish between two main cases: the birth of Population III.1 stars—those which form in the pristine halos unaffected by prior star formation—and the formation of Population III.2 stars—those forming in halos where the gas has an increased ionization fraction. We find that turbulent primordial gas is highly susceptible to fragmentation in both cases, even for turbulence in the subsonic regime, i.e., for rms velocity dispersions as low as 20{\%} of the sound speed. Fragmentation is more vigorous and more widespread in pristine halos compared to pre-ionized ones. If such levels of turbulent motions were indeed present in star-forming minihalos, Population III.1 stars would be on average of somewhat lower mass, and form in larger groups, than Population III.2 stars. We find that fragment masses cover over two orders of magnitude, suggesting that the Population III initial mass function may have been much broader than previously thought. This prompts the need for a large, high-resolution study of the formation of dark matter minihalos that is capable of resolving the turbulent flows in the gas at the moment when the baryons become self-gravitating. This would help to determine the applicability of our results to primordial star formation.},

abstract = {It has been proposed theoretically that the first generation of stars in the Universe (population III) would be as massive as 100 solar masses (100Mo), because of inefficient cooling of the precursor gas clouds. Recently, the most iron-deficient (but still carbon-rich) low-mass star -- HE0107-5240 -- was discovered. If this is a population III that gained its metals (elements heavier than helium) after its formation, it would challenge the theoretical picture of the formation of the first stars. Here we report that the patterns of elemental abundance in HE0107-5240 (and other extremely metal-poor stars) are in good accord with the nucleosynthesis that occurs in stars with masses of 20-130Mo when they become supernovae if, during the explosions, the ejecta undergo substantial mixing and fall-back to form massive black holes. Such supernovae have been observed. The abundance patterns are not, however, consistent with enrichment by supernovae from stars in the range 130-300 Mo. We accordingly infer that the first-generation supernovae came mostly from explosions of {\~{}} 20-130Mo stars; some of these produced iron-poor but carbon- and oxygen-rich ejecta. Low-mass second-generation stars, like HE0107-5240, could form because the carbon and oxygen provided pathways for gas to cool.},

abstract = {It has recently been demonstrated that coherent relative streaming velocities of order 30 km s-1 between dark matter and gas permeated the universe on scales below a few Mpc directly after recombination. Here we use a series of high-resolution moving-mesh calculations to show that these supersonic motions significantly influence the virialization of the gas in minihalos and delay the formation of the first stars. As the gas streams into minihalos with bulk velocities around 1 km s-1 at z {\~{}} 20, the additional momentum and energy input reduces the gas fractions and central densities of the halos, increasing the typical virial mass required for efficient cooling by a factor of three and delaying Population III star formation by $\Delta$z {\~{}}= 4. Since the distribution of the magnitude of the streaming velocities is narrowly peaked around a non-negligible value, this effect is important in most regions of the universe. As a consequence, the increased minimum halo mass implies a reduction of the absolute number of minihalos that can be expected to cool and form Population III stars by up to an order of magnitude. We further find that the streaming velocities increase the turbulent velocity dispersion of the minihalo gas, which could affect its ability to fragment and hence alter the mass function of the first stars.},

abstract = {The combination of seven-year data from WMAP and improved astrophysical data rigorously tests the standard cosmological model and places new constraints on its basic parameters and extensions. By combining the WMAP data with the latest distance measurements from the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies and the Hubble constant (H 0) measurement, we determine the parameters of the simplest six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model. The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is ns = 0.968 ± 0.012 (68{\%} CL) for this data combination, a measurement that excludes the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles spectrum by 99.5{\%} CL. The other parameters, including those beyond the minimal set, are also consistent with, and improved from, the five-year results. We find no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The seven-year temperature power spectrum gives a better determination of the third acoustic peak, which results in a better determination of the redshift of the matter-radiation equality epoch. Notable examples of improved parameters are the total mass of neutrinos, ∑m $\nu$ {\textless} 0.58 eV(95{\%}CL), and the effective number of neutrino species, N eff = 4.34+0.86 -0.88 (68{\%} CL), which benefit from better determinations of the third peak and H 0. The limit on a constant dark energy equation of state parameter from WMAP+BAO+H 0, without high-redshift Type Ia supernovae, is w = -1.10 ± 0.14 (68{\%} CL). We detect the effect of primordial helium on the temperature power spectrum and provide a new test of big bang nucleosynthesis by measuring Yp = 0.326 ± 0.075 (68{\%} CL). We detect, and show on the map for the first time, the tangential and radial polarization patterns around hot and cold spots of temperature fluctuations, an important test of physical processes at z = 1090 and the dominance of adiabatic scalar fluctuations. The seven-year polarization data have significantly improved: we now detect the temperature-E-mode polarization cross power spectrum at 21$\sigma$, compared with 13$\sigma$ from the five-year data. With the seven-year temperature-B-mode cross power spectrum, the limit on a rotation of the polarization plane due to potential parity-violating effects has improved by 38{\%} to $\backslash$Delta $\backslash$alpha =-1$\backslash$mbox{\{}.$\backslash$!$\backslash$!{\^{}}$\backslash$circ {\}}1$\backslash$pm 1$\backslash$mbox{\{}.$\backslash$!$\backslash$!{\^{}}$\backslash$circ {\}}4 ($\backslash$rm statistical)$\backslash$pm 1$\backslash$mbox{\{}.$\backslash$!$\backslash$!{\^{}}$\backslash$circ {\}}5 ($\backslash$rm systematic) (68{\%} CL). We report significant detections of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect at the locations of known clusters of galaxies. The measured SZ signal agrees well with the expected signal from the X-ray data on a cluster-by-cluster basis. However, it is a factor of 0.5-0.7 times the predictions from "universal profile" of Arnaud et al., analytical models, and hydrodynamical simulations. We find, for the first time in the SZ effect, a significant difference between the cooling-flow and non-cooling-flow clusters (or relaxed and non-relaxed clusters), which can explain some of the discrepancy. This lower amplitude is consistent with the lower-than-theoretically expected SZ power spectrum recently measured by the South Pole Telescope Collaboration. WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP Science Team.},

abstract = {(Abridged) We present the angular power spectra derived from the 7-year maps and discuss the cosmological conclusions that can be inferred from WMAP data alone. The third acoustic peak in the TT spectrum is now well measured by WMAP. In the context of a flat LambdaCDM model, this improvement allows us to place tighter constraints on the matter density from WMAP data alone, and on the epoch of matter-radiation equality, The temperature-polarization (TE) spectrum is detected in the 7-year data with a significance of 20 sigma, compared to 13 sigma with the 5-year data. The low-l EE spectrum, a measure of the optical depth due to reionization, is detected at 5.5 sigma significance when averaged over l = 2-7. The BB spectrum, an important probe of gravitational waves from inflation, remains consistent with zero. The upper limit on tensor modes from polarization data alone is a factor of 2 lower with the 7-year data than it was using the 5-year data (Komatsu et al. 2010). We test the parameter recovery process for bias and find that the scalar spectral index, ns, is biased high, but only by 0.09 sigma, while the remaining parameters are biased by {\textless} 0.15 sigma. The improvement in the third peak measurement leads to tighter lower limits from WMAP on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom (e.g., neutrinos) in the early universe: Neff {\textgreater} 2.7 (95{\%} CL). Also, using WMAP data alone, the primordial helium mass fraction is found to be YHe = 0.28+0.14-0.15, and with data from higher-resolution CMB experiments included, we now establish the existence of pre-stellar helium at {\textgreater} 3 sigma (Komatsu et al. 2010).},

abstract = {This review discusses smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) in the astrophysical context, with a focus on inviscid gas dynamics. The particle-based SPH technique allows an intuitive and simple formulation of hydrodynamics that has excellent conservation properties and can be coupled to self-gravity with high accuracy. The Lagrangian character of SPH allows it to automatically adjust its resolution to the clumping of matter, a property that makes the scheme ideal for many application areas in astrophysics, where often a large dynamic range in density is encountered. We discuss the derivation of the basic SPH equations in their modern formulation, and give an overview about extensions of SPH developed to treat physics such as radiative transfer, thermal conduction, relativistic dynamics, or magnetic fields. We also briefly describe some of the most important applications areas of SPH in astrophysical research. Finally, we provide a critical discussion of the accuracy of SPH for different hydrodynamical problems, including measurements of its convergence rate for important classes of problems.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggest that the initial mass function (IMF) of the first stars (Population III) is likely to have been extremely top-heavy, unlike what is observed at present. We propose a scenario to generate fragmentation to lower masses once the first massive stars have formed and derive constraints on the primordial IMF. We estimate the mass fraction of pair-unstable supernovae (SN$\gamma$$\gamma$), shown to be the dominant sources of the first heavy elements. These metals enrich the surrounding gas up to {\~{}}10-4 Zsolar, when a transition to efficient cooling-driven fragmentation producing {\textless}{\~{}}1 Msolar clumps occurs. We argue that the remaining fraction of the first stars ends up in {\~{}}100 Msolar VMBHs (very massive black holes). If we further assume that all these VMBHs are likely to end up in the centers of galactic nuclei constituting the observed supermassive black holes (SMBHs), then {\~{}}6{\%} of the first stars contributed to the initial metal enrichment and the IMF remained top-heavy down to a redshift z{\~{}}18.5{\%}. Interestingly, this is the epoch at which the cool metals detected in the Ly$\alpha$ forest at z{\~{}}3 must have been ejected from galaxies. At the other extreme, if none of these VMBHs has as yet ended up in SMBHs, we expect them to be either (1) en route toward galactic nuclei, thereby accounting for the X-ray-bright off-center sources detected locally by ROSAT, or (2) the dark matter candidate composing the entire baryonic halos of galaxies. For case 1 we expect all but a negligible fraction of the primordial stars to produce metals, causing the transition at the maximum possible redshift of {\textgreater}{\~{}}22.1, and for case 2, {\~{}}3×105, a very negligible fraction of the initial stars produce the metals and the transition redshift occurs at zf{\textgreater}{\~{}}5.4. In this paper, we present a framework (albeit one that is not stringently constrained at present) that relates the first episode of star formation to the fate of their remnants at late times. Clearly, further progress in understanding the formation and fragmentation of Population III stars within the cosmological context will provide tighter constraints in the future. We conclude with a discussion of several hitherto unexplored implications of a high-mass-dominated star formation mode in the early universe.},

abstract = {We discuss differences in simulation results that arise between the use of either the thermal energy or the entropy as an independent variable in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). In this context, we derive a new version of SPH that, when appropriate, manifestly conserves both energy and entropy if smoothing lengths are allowed to adapt freely to the local mass resolution. To test various formulations of SPH, we consider point-like energy injection, as in certain models of supernova feedback, and find that powerful explosions are well represented by SPH even when the energy is deposited into a single particle, provided that the entropy equation is integrated. If the thermal energy is instead used as an independent variable, unphysical solutions can be obtained for this problem. We also examine the radiative cooling of gas spheres that collapse and virialize in isolation, and of haloes that form in cosmological simulations of structure formation. When applied to these problems, the thermal energy version of SPH leads to substantial overcooling in haloes that are resolved with up to a few thousand particles, while the entropy formulation is biased only moderately low for these haloes under the same circumstances. For objects resolved with much larger particle numbers, the two approaches yield consistent results. We trace the origin of the differences to systematic resolution effects in the outer parts of cooling flows. When the thermal energy equation is integrated and the resolution is low, the compressional heating of the gas in the inflow region is underestimated, violating entropy conservation and improperly accelerating cooling. The cumulative effect of this overcooling can be significant. In cosmological simulations of moderate size, we find that the fraction of baryons which cool and condense can be reduced by up to a factor {\~{}}2 if the entropy equation is employed rather than the thermal energy equation, partly explaining discrepancies with semi-analytic treatments of galaxy formation. We also demonstrate that the entropy method leads to a greatly reduced scatter in the density-temperature relation of the low-density Ly$\alpha$ forest relative to the thermal energy approach, in accord with theoretical expectations.},

We have simulated a large number of different clouds, with volume and column densities spanning a wide range of different values, using a state-of-the-art model for the coupled chemical, thermal and dynamical evolution of the gas. We show that star formation is only possible in regions where the mean (area-averaged) column density exceeds 1021 cm-2. Within the clouds, we also show that there is a good correlation between the mass of gas above a K-band extinction AK = 0.8 and the star formation rate (SFR), in agreement with recent observational work. Previously, this relationship has been explained in terms of a correlation between the SFR and the mass in dense gas. However, we find that this correlation is weaker and more time dependent than that between the SFR and the column density. In support of previous studies, we argue that dust shielding is the key process: the true correlation is one between the SFR and the mass in cold, well-shielded gas, and the latter correlates better with the column density than the volume density.},

abstract = {Context: Low-energy cosmic rays are a fundamental source of ionization for molecular clouds, influencing their chemical, thermal, and dynamical evolution. Aims: The purpose of this work is to explore the possibility that a low-energy component of cosmic rays, not directly measurable from the Earth, can account for the discrepancy between the ionization rate measured in diffuse and dense interstellar clouds. Methods: We collected the most recent experimental and theoretical data on the cross sections for the production of H2+ and He+ by electron and proton impact and discuss the available constraints on the cosmic-ray fluxes in the local interstellar medium. Starting from different extrapolations at low energies of the demodulated cosmic-ray proton and electron spectra, we computed the propagated spectra in molecular clouds in the continuous slowing-down approximation taking all the relevant energy loss processes into account. Results: The theoretical value of the cosmic-ray ionization rate as a function of the column density of traversed matter agrees with the observational data only if the flux of either cosmic-ray electrons or of protons increases at low energies. The most successful models are characterized by a significant (or even dominant) contribution of the electron component to the ionization rate, in agreement with previous suggestions. However, the large spread of cosmic-ray ionization rates inferred from chemical models of molecular cloud cores remains to be explained. Conclusions: Available data combined with simple propagation models support the existence of a low-energy component (below {\~{}}100 MeV) of cosmic-ray electrons or protons responsible for the ionization of molecular cloud cores and dense protostellar envelopes.},

abstract = {We develop a formalism for the identification and accurate estimation of the strength of structure formation shocks during cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. Shocks play a decisive role not only for the thermalization of gas in virializing structures but also for the acceleration of relativistic cosmic rays (CRs) through diffusive shock acceleration. Our formalism is applicable both to ordinary non-relativistic thermal gas, and to plasmas composed of CRs and thermal gas. To this end, we derive an analytic solution to the one-dimensional Riemann shock tube problem for a composite plasma of CRs and thermal gas. We apply our methods to study the properties of structure formation shocks in high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of the Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. We find that most of the energy is dissipated in weak internal shocks with Mach numbers which are predominantly central flow shocks or merger shock waves traversing halo centres. Collapsed cosmological structures are surrounded by external shocks with much higher Mach numbers up to , but they play only a minor role in the energy balance of thermalization. This is because of the higher pre-shock gas densities within non-linear structures, and the significant increase of the mean shock speed as the characteristic halo mass grows with cosmic time. We show that after the epoch of cosmic reionization the Mach number distribution is significantly modified by an efficient suppression of strong external shock waves due to the associated increase of the sound speed of the diffuse gas. Invoking a model for CR acceleration in shock waves, we find that the average strength of shock waves responsible for CR energy injection is higher than that for shocks that dominate the thermalization of the gas. This implies that the dynamical importance of shock-injected CRs is comparatively large in the low-density, peripheral halo infalling regions, but is less important for the weaker flow shocks occurring in central high-density regions of haloes. When combined with radiative dissipation and star formation, our formalism can also be used to study CR injection by supernova shocks, or to construct models for shock-induced star formation in the interstellar medium.},

The code uses Monte Carlo methods to obtain a self-consistent description of the plasma state and to compute a synthetic spectrum. It has a modular design to facilitate the implementation of a range of physical approximations that can be compared to assess both accuracy and computational expediency. This will allow users to choose a level of sophistication appropriate for their application. Here, we describe the operation of the code and make comparisons with alternative radiative transfer codes of differing levels of complexity (SYN++, PYTHON and ARTIS). We then explore the consequence of adopting simple prescriptions for the calculation of atomic excitation, focusing on four species of relevance to Type Ia SN spectra - Si II, S II, Mg II and Ca II. We also investigate the influence of three methods for treating line interactions on our synthetic spectra and the need for accurate radiative rate estimates in our scheme.},

abstract = {Supernova (SN) driven winds are widely thought to be very influential in the high-redshift Universe, shaping the properties of the circumgalactic medium, enriching the intergalactic medium with metals and driving the evolution of low-mass galaxies. However, it is not yet fully understood how SN-driven winds interact with their surroundings in a cosmological context, nor is it clear whether they are able to significantly impact the evolution of low-mass galaxies from which they originate by altering the amount of the cold material these accrete from the cosmic web. Indeed, due to the strong constraints on resolution imposed by limited computational power, all cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to date resort to implementing more or less physically well motivated and complex subgrid models to trigger galactic winds. To explore this issue, we implement a standard Taylor-Sedov type solution, widely used in the community to depict the combined action of many SN explosions, in a cosmological resimulation of a low-mass galaxy at z≥ 9 from the 'NUT' suite. However, in contrast with previous work, we achieve a resolution high enough to capture individual SN remnants in the Taylor-Sedov phase, for which the Taylor-Sedov solution actually provides an accurate description of the expansion. We report the development of a high-velocity, far-reaching galactic wind produced by the combined action of SNe in the main galaxy and its satellites, which are located in the same or a neighbouring dark matter halo. Despite this, we find that (i) this wind carries out very little mass (the measured outflow is of the order of a tenth of the inflow/star formation rate); and (ii) the cold gas inflow rate remains essentially unchanged from the run without SN feedback. Moreover, there are epochs during which star formation is enhanced in the feedback run relative to its radiative-cooling-only counterpart. We attribute this 'positive' feedback to the metal enrichment that is present only in the former.

Beginning with the pre-galactic evolution of baryonic material we describe the analytical and numerical understanding of how baryons condense into galaxies, what determines the structure of those galaxies and how internal and external processes (including star formation, merging, active galactic nuclei etc.) determine their gross properties and evolution. Throughout, we highlight successes and failings of current galaxy formation theory. We include a review of computational implementations of galaxy formation theory and assess their ability to provide reliable modeling of this complex phenomenon.

It is argued that the similarity solution of Larson and Penston (1969) for the stages before core formation is physically artificial, but the gasdynamic flow subsequent to core formation exhibits self-similar properties. Similarity solutions are determined for the collapse of singular isothermal spheres, minus solutions without critical points are obtained by imposing the condition that the fluid velocities are negligible at the 'initial instant', and an expansion-wave collapse solution is evaluated. The results are illustrated with a numerical example roughly corresponding to conditions appropriate for Bok globules or the central regions of a nonmagnetic molecular cloud. Two possible applications of the solutions are discussed: analyzing the stability to gravitational fragmentation of collapsing pressure-free gas spheres and determining the amount of energy radiated away during protostar formation.},

abstract = {We investigate the process of metal-free star formation in the first galaxies with a high-resolution cosmological simulation. We consider the cosmologically motivated scenario in which a strong molecule-destroying Lyman-Werner (LW) background inhibits effective cooling in low-mass haloes, delaying star formation until the collapse or more massive haloes. Only when molecular hydrogen (H2) can self-shield from LW radiation, which requires a halo capable of cooling by atomic line emission, will star formation be possible. To follow the formation of multiple gravitationally bound objects, at high gas densities we introduce sink particles which accrete gas directly from the computational grid. We find that in a 1 Mpc3 (comoving) box, runaway collapse first occurs in a 3 × 107 M⊙ dark matter halo at z ≈ 12 assuming a background intensity of J21 = 100. Due to a runaway increase in the H2 abundance and cooling rate, a self-shielding, supersonically turbulent core develops abruptly with ˜104 M⊙ in cold gas available for star formation. We analyse the formation of this self-shielding core, the character of turbulence and the prospects for star formation. Due to a lack of fragmentation on scales we resolve, we argue that LW-delayed metal-free star formation in atomic cooling haloes is very similar to star formation in primordial minihaloes, although in making this conclusion we ignore internal stellar feedback. Finally, we briefly discuss the detectability of metal-free stellar clusters with the James Webb Space Telescope.},

(1) Photodissociation of H2 in the local dark matter minihalo occurs early in the growth of the protostar but does not affect subsequent accretion. (2) Ly$\alpha$ radiation pressure acting at the boundary of the H II region that the protostar creates in the accreting envelope reverses infall in the polar directions when the star reaches {\~{}}20-30 Msolar but cannot prevent infall from other directions. (3) Expansion of the H II region beyond the gravitational escape radius for ionized gas occurs at masses {\~{}}50-100 Msolar. However, accretion from the equatorial regions can continue since the neutral accretion disk shields a substantial fraction of the accretion envelope from direct ionizing flux. (4) At higher stellar masses, {\~{}}140 Msolar in the fiducial case, photoevaporation-driven mass loss from the disk, together with declining accretion rates, halts the increase in the protostellar mass. We identify this process as the mechanism that determines the mass of Population III.1 stars (i.e., stars with primordial composition that have not been affected by prior star formation). The initial mass function of these stars is set by the distribution of entropy and angular momentum. The Appendix gives approximate solutions to a number of problems relevant to the formation of the first stars: the effect of Rayleigh scattering on line profiles in media of very large optical depth, the intensity of Ly$\alpha$ radiation in very opaque media, radiative acceleration in terms of the gradient of a modified radiation pressure, the flux of radiation in a shell with an arbitrary distribution of opacity, and the vertical structure of an accretion disk supported by gas pressure with constant opacity.},

HD-line cooling dominates the thermal balance of clouds when Z{\~{}}10-5 to 10-3 Zsolar and density {\~{}}105 cm-3. Early on, CMB radiation prevents the gas temperature from falling below TCMB, although this hardly alters the cloud thermal evolution in low-metallicity gas. From the derived temperature evolution, we assess cloud/core fragmentation as a function of metallicity from linear perturbation theory, which requires that the core elongation E≡(b-a)/a{\textgreater}ENL{\~{}}1, where a (b) is the short (long) core axis length. The fragment mass is given by the thermal Jeans mass at E=ENL. Given these assumptions and the initial (Gaussian) distribution of E, we compute the fragment mass distribution as a function of metallicity. We find that (1) for Z=0, all fragments are very massive, {\textless}{\~{}}103 Msolar, consistent with previous studies; (2) for Z{\textgreater}10-6 Zsolar a few clumps go through an additional high-density ({\textgreater}{\~{}}1010 cm-3) fragmentation phase driven by dust cooling, leading to low-mass fragments; (3) the mass fraction in low-mass fragments is initially very small, but at Z{\~{}}10-5 Zsolar it becomes dominant and continues to grow as Z is increased; (4) as a result of the two fragmentation modes, a bimodal mass distribution emerges in 0.01{\textless}Z/Zsolar{\textless}0.1 and (5) for {\textgreater}{\~{}}0.1 Zsolar, the two peaks merge into a single-peaked mass function, which might be regarded as the precursor of the ordinary Salpeter-like initial mass function.},

We consider Type II supernovae, hypernovae, and pair instability supernovae (PISN) in halos from 6.9×105 to 1.2×107 Msolar, those in which Population III stars are expected to form via H 2 cooling. Our simulations are the first to follow the evolution of the blast from a free expansion on spatial scales of 10-4 pc until its approach to pressure equilibrium in the relic H II region of the progenitor, {\~{}}1000 pc. Supernovae in H II regions first expand adiabatically and then radiate strongly upon collision with baryons ejected from the halo during its photoevaporation by the progenitor. In contrast to previous findings, supernovae in neutral halos promptly emit most of their kinetic energy as X-rays, but retain enough momentum to seriously disrupt the halo. Explosions in H II regions escape into the IGM, but neutral halos confine the blast and its metals. In H II regions, a prompt second generation of stars may form in the remnant at radii of 100-200 pc. Explosions confined by massive halos instead recollapse, with infall rates in excess of 10-2 Msolar yr-1 that heavily contaminate their interior. This fallback may either fuel massive black hole growth at very high redshifts or create the first globular clusters with radii of 10-20 pc at the center of the halo. Our findings suggest that the first primitive galaxies may therefore have formed sooner, with greater numbers of stars and distinct chemical signatures, than in current models.},

abstract = {While stars are widely discussed as the source of the high-energy photons that reionized the universe, an additional source of ionizing photons that must also contribute to reionization in this scenario are the supernovae (SNe) which mark the end of the life of massive stars. Here we estimate the relative contributions of SNe and stars to reionization. While the rate at which ionizing photons are produced in SNe shocks is well below that at which they are produced by stars, the harder spectra of radiation emitted from SNe lead to an enhanced escape fraction of SN-generated photons relative to that of stellar photons. In particular, along a given line of sight out of a galaxy, we find that for neutral hydrogen column densities N H {\textgreater}{\~{}} 1018 cm-2 the contribution to reionization from SNe is greater than that from stars. Drawing on the results of simulations presented in the literature, we find that the overall (line-of-sight-averaged) SNe shock-generated ionizing photon escape fraction is larger than the stellar photon escape fraction by a factor of sime4 to sime7, depending on the metallicity of the stellar population. Overall, our results suggest that the effect of SNe is an enhancement of up to {\~{}}10{\%} in the fraction of hydrogen reionized by stellar sources. We briefly discuss the implications of our results for the population of galaxies responsible for reionization.},

The distribution of halo formation times and survival times is calculated. A Monte Carlo method for constructing representative histories of merger events leading to the formation of halos of a prescribed mass is also described. From the application of these results to the age distribution of rich clusters of galaxies, it is inferred that a high value of the density parameter (greater than about 0.5) is required to reproduce the substantial fraction of rich clusters that exhibit such substructure, if this substructure only persists for a time of 0.2 t(0) after a merger, where t(0) is the present age of the universe.},

abstract = {We use numerical simulations to investigate the importance of HD formation and cooling on the first generation of metal-free stars in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We have implemented and tested non-equilibrium HD chemistry in an adaptive mesh refinement simulation code and applied it to two situations. (1) It is first applied to the formation of 105-106 Msolar halos which form in the absence of any ionizing source (``unperturbed'' halos). We show, in agreement with previous work, that HD cooling is of only marginal importance for most halos; however, we find that for the lowest mass halos, with masses a few times 105 Msolar, HD cooling can equal or surpass the H2 cooling rate. This leads to a population of stars formed in halos with effective HD cooling that are less massive by a factor of {\~{}}6 compared to halos dominated by H2 cooling. (2) In the second part of the paper, we ionize the halos in order to explore the impact of HD cooling in the presence of an ample population of free electrons. This leads to cooler temperatures (due to the electron-catalyzed production of H2), implying somewhat lower resulting protostellar mass. Adding HD chemistry changes this by lowering the temperature further, to the level of the CMB. We find that HD cooling dominates over H2 cooling in the density range 102-106 cm-3, but above this density, the temperature rises and H2 cooling dominates again. Because of this, the accretion rate on to the protostar is almost the same as in the H2 case (at least for accreted masses below 50-100 Msolar) therefore we argue that HD cooling in ionized halos will probably not result in a population of significantly lower mass stars.},

abstract = {We critique the hypothesis that the first stars were very massive stars (VMSs; M{\textgreater}140Msolar). We review the two major lines of evidence for the existence of VMSs: (1) that the relative metal abundances of extremely metal-poor Galactic halo stars show evidence of VMS enrichment and (2) that the high electron-scattering optical depth ($\tau$e) to the cosmic microwave background found by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) requires VMSs for reionization in a concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The yield patterns of VMSs exploding as pair-instability supernovae are incompatible with the Fe-peak and r-process abundances in halo stars. Models including Type II supernovae and/or ``hypernovae'' from zero-metallicity progenitors with M=8-40Msolar can better explain the observed trends. We use the nucleosynthesis results and stellar evolution models to construct an initial mass function (IMF) for reionization. With a simple metal transport model, we estimate that halo enrichment curtails metal-free star formation after {\~{}}108 yr at z{\~{}}20. Because the lifetime-integrated ionizing photon efficiency of metal-free stars peaks at {\~{}}120 Msolar and declines at higher mass, an IMF with an approximate lower bound at M{\~{}}10-20Msolar and no VMS can maximize the ionizing photon budget and still be consistent with the nucleosynthetic evidence. An IMF devoid of low-mass stars is justified independently by models of the formation of primordial stars. Using a semianalytic model for H I and He II reionization, we find that such an IMF can reproduce $\tau$e{\~{}}=0.10-0.14, consistent with the range from WMAP, without extreme astrophysical assumptions, provided that metal-free star formation persists 107-108 yr after star formation begins. Because stars in the mass range 50-140 Msolar are the most efficient sources of ionizing photons but are expected to collapse to black holes without releasing metals, this IMF effectively decouples early metal enrichment and early ionization. Such an IMF may allow the unique properties of the zero-metallicity IMF to persist longer than they would in the pure VMS case and to contribute significantly to the global ionizing photon budget before halo self-enrichment and/or interhalo metal transport truncates metal-free star formation. We conclude, on the basis of these results, that VMSs are not necessary to meet the existing constraints commonly taken to motivate them.},

abstract = {We present a light and fast, publicly available, ray-tracer Splotch software tool which supports the effective visualization of cosmological simulations data. We describe the algorithm it relies on, which is designed in order to deal with point-like data, optimizing the ray-tracing calculation by ordering the particles as a function of their 'depth', defined as a function of one of the coordinates or other associated parameters. Realistic three-dimensional impressions are reached through a composition of the final colour in each pixel properly calculating emission and absorption of individual volume elements. We describe several scientific as well as public applications realized with Splotch. We emphasize how different datasets and configurations lead to remarkably different results in terms of the images and animations. A few of these results are available online.},

abstract = {Using new sets of stellar evolution models at very low metallicities (Z = 10-7, 10-5) and previously published grids we examine spectral properties of the ionising continua, the Lyman-break, and the Lyalpha and He I lambda 4471iuv recombination lines in starbursts. The metallicity dependence of these properties, especially the transition from primordial galaxies (Population III) to currently observed metallicities, is examined for various IMFs and star formation histories. For the average properties of starbursts, approximated by a model with constant star formation, the main findings are: - The Lyman continuum flux Q(H) increases with decreasing metallicity. For a universal Salpeter IMF from 1-100 Msun the enhancement reaches typically a factor of {\~{}} 3 between solar metallicity and Pop III objects. - While for metallicities Z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 1/50 Zsun the amplitude of the Lyman-break depends little on Z, a reduction by a factor {\~{}} 2 is found at lower metallicities, due to the strong increase of the average stellar temperature. - Using theoretical models and empirical constraints we discuss the expected evolution of the hardness of He+ to H ionising photons, Q(He+)/Q(H), with metallicity and possible uncertainties. Over the metallicity range Z=0 to {\~{}} 10-4 the hardness decreases from log (Q(He+)/Q(H)) {\~{}} -1.4 ... -2.3 by {\~{}} 1.5-2 or more orders of magnitude, depending strongly on the upper mass cut-off of the IMF. From empirical constraints we derive a hardness log (Q(He+)/Q(H)) {\~{}} -3.2 to -2.6 for metal-poor starbursts (1/25 {\textless}{\~{}} Z/Zsun {\textless}{\~{}} 1/4) and softer spectra for higher metallicities. We also provide a simple estimate of the possible impact of hot WR like stars on Q(He+)/Q(H) at very low metallicities (Z {\textless}{\~{}} 10-4). - Calibrations for star formation rate determinations from various recombination lines at all metallicities and for various IMFs are derived. For young bursts the maximum Lyalpha equivalent width is shown to increase strongly with decreasing metallicity from W(Lyalpha ) {\~{}} 250-350 {\AA} at Z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 1/50 Zsun to 400-850 {\AA} or higher at Z between 10-5 and 0 (Pop III) for the same Salpeter IMF. However, for well known reasons, the Lyalpha emission predicted likely represents an upper limit. Non-negligible He I lambda 4471iuv emission due to stellar photoionisation appears to be limited to very small metallicities (log (Z/Zsun) {\textless}{\~{}} -5.3) and Population III objects. The predictions, available on the Web through the CDS and at http://webast.ast.obs-mip.fr/sfr/, should be useful for a variety of studies regarding high redshift galaxies, cosmological reionisation, and others.

abstract = {We present numerical simulations of how a 120 M⊙ primordial star regulates star formation in nearby cosmological halos at z {\~{}} 20 by photoevaporation. Our models include nine-species primordial chemistry and self-consistent multifrequency conservative transfer of UV photons with all relevant radiative processes. Whether or not new stars form in halos clustered around a Population III star ultimately depends on their core densities and proximity to the star. Diffuse halos with central densities below 2-3 cm-3 are completely ionized and evaporated anywhere in the cluster. Evolved halos with core densities above 2000 cm-3 are impervious to both ionizing and Lyman-Werner flux at most distances from the star and collapse as quickly as they would in its absence. Star formation in halos of intermediate density can be either promoted or suppressed depending on how the ionization front (I-front) remnant shock compresses, deforms, and enriches the core with H2. We find that the 120 M⊙ star photodissociates H2 in most halos in the cluster, but that catalysis by H- restores it a few hundred kiloyears after the death of the star, with little effect on star formation. Our models exhibit significant departures from previous one-dimensional, spherically symmetric simulations, which are prone to serious errors due to unphysical geometric focusing effects.},

abstract = {We have carried out a comparison study of hydrodynamical codes by investigating their performance in modelling interacting multiphase fluids. The two commonly used techniques of grid and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) show striking differences in their ability to model processes that are fundamentally important across many areas of astrophysics. Whilst Eulerian grid based methods are able to resolve and treat important dynamical instabilities, such as Kelvin-Helmholtz or Rayleigh-Taylor, these processes are poorly or not at all resolved by existing SPH techniques. We show that the reason for this is that SPH, at least in its standard implementation, introduces spurious pressure forces on particles in regions where there are steep density gradients. This results in a boundary gap of the size of an SPH smoothing kernel radius over which interactions are severely damped.},

abstract = {We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to data, using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

abstract = {The first stars to form in the universe are believed to have distribution of masses biased toward massive stars. This contrasts with the present-day initial mass function, which has a predominance of stars with masses lower than 1 M sun. Therefore, the mode of star formation must have changed as the universe evolved. Such a transition is attributed to a more efficient cooling provided by increasing metallicity. Especially dust cooling can overcome the compressional heating, which lowers the gas temperature thus increasing its instability to fragmentation. The purpose of this paper is to verify if dust cooling can efficiently cool the gas, and enhance the fragmentation of gas clouds at the early stages of the universe. To confirm that, we calculate a set of hydrodynamic simulations that include sink particles, which represent contracting protostars. The thermal evolution of the gas during the collapse is followed by making use of a primordial chemical network and also a recipe for dust cooling. We model four clouds with different amounts of metals (10-4, 10-5, 10-6 Z sun, and 0), and analyze how this property affect the fragmentation of star-forming clouds. We find evidence for fragmentation in all four cases, and hence conclude that there is no critical metallicity below which fragmentation is impossible. Nevertheless, there is a clear change in the behavior of the clouds at Z {\textless}{\~{}} 10-5 Z sun, caused by the fact that at this metallicity, fragmentation takes longer to occur than accretion, leading to a flat mass function at lower metallicities.},

abstract = {We investigate the formation of a galaxy reaching a virial mass of {\~{}}10{\^{}}8 at z{\~{}}10 by carrying out a zoomed radiation-hydrodynamical cosmological simulation. This simulation traces Population{\~{}}III (Pop{\~{}}III) star formation, characterized by a modestly top-heavy initial mass function (IMF), and considers stellar feedback such as photoionization heating from Pop{\~{}}III and Population{\~{}}II (Pop{\~{}}II) stars, mechanical and chemical feedback from supernovae (SNe), and X-ray feedback from accreting black holes (BHs) and high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). We self-consistently impose a transition in star formation mode from top-heavy Pop{\~{}}III to low-mass Pop{\~{}}II at the critical metallicity Zcrit=10{\^{}}{\{}-3.5{\}} solar metallicity. We find that the star formation rate in the computational box is dominated by Pop{\~{}}III until z{\~{}}13, and by Pop{\~{}}II thereafter. The intergalactic medium (IGM) is metal-enriched to an average of Zavg=10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}} solar metallicity at z{\~{}}10, mainly by pair-instability SNe (PISNe), while 70{\%} of the produced Pop{\~{}}III stars die in core-collapse SNe (CCSNe). The simulated galaxy experiences bursty star formation, with a substantially reduced gas content due to photoionization heating from Pop{\~{}}III and Pop{\~{}}II stars, together with SN feedback. Specifically, this gives rise to a baryon fraction of fbar=0.05 at z{\~{}}10. All the gas within the simulated galaxy is metal-enriched above 10{\^{}}{\{}-5{\}}$\backslash$zsun, such that there are no remaining pockets of primordial gas. We further estimate the intrinsic luminosity of the simulated galaxy to be L{\_}Bol {\~{}} 5 x 10{\^{}}6 solar luminosity, corresponding to an observed flux of {\~{}} 10{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}} nJy, which is too low to be detected by the JWST.

It is noted that such fast shocks initially dissociate almost all preexisting molecules. Discussion covers the physical processes which determine the post shock structure between 10 to the 4 and 10 to the 2 K. It is shown that the chemistry of important molecular coolants H2, CO, OH, and H2O, as well as HD and CH, is reduced to a relatively small set of gas phase and grain surface reactions. Also, the chemistry follows the slow conversion of atomic hydrogen into H2, which primarily occurs on grain surfaces. The dependence of this H2 formation rate on grain and gas temperatures is examined and the survival of grains behind fast shocks is discussed. Post shock heating and cooling rates are calculated and an appropriate, analytic, universal cooling function is developed for molecules other than hydrogen which includes opacities from both the dust and the lines.},

abstract = {In the context of star formation through fragmentation of an extremely metal deficient protogalactic cloud, the gravitational collapse of filamentary gas clouds is explored with one-dimensional numerical hydrodynamics coupled with nonequilibrium chemistry of H2 and HD. It is found that the cloud evolution is governed mainly by the initial central density (nc,0) and H2 abundance (xH2,0). In particular, the evolution of low-density filaments (nc,0{\textless}{\~{}}105 cm-3) bifurcates at a threshold H2 abundance of xH2,cr{\~{}}=3×10-3, beyond which HD cooling overwhelms H2 cooling. The contraction of a filament with nc,0{\textless}{\~{}}105 cm-3 and xH2,0{\textgreater}{\~{}}xH2,cr is strongly decelerated when the central density (nc) reaches a critical density of HD at which LTE level populations are achieved, and therefore the filament is expected to fragment at {\~{}}107 cm-3. The fragment mass is lowered to be {\~{}}10 Msolar. In contrast, the contraction of a filament with nc,0{\textless}{\~{}}105 cm-3 and xH2,0{\textless}{\~{}}xH2,cr is regulated by H2 cooling. In this case, the filament tends to fragment at lower density as {\~{}}104 cm-3 owing to the low critical density of H2, and the fragment mass is as high as {\~{}}102 Msolar. For a high-density filament with nc,0{\textgreater}{\~{}}105 cm-3, the temperature stays at a relatively high value because both H2 and HD cooling saturate, and the cloud evolution is governed by H2 cooling. The contraction of a high-density filament is accelerated by effective three-body H2 formation when the density reaches 108-109 cm-3. Fragmentation is not expected to take place until the cloud becomes opaque in H2 lines at nc,0{\~{}}1012-1013 cm-3, so that the fragment mass is reduced to 1-2 Msolar. As a result, the stellar initial mass function could be bimodal and deficient in sub-solar mass stars, where the high-mass peak is around 10 or 102 Msolar, dependent on nc,0 and xH2,0. If the protogalactic clouds are ionized by UV radiation or strong shocks, the H2 abundance could exceed xH2,cr{\~{}}=3×10-3 by reactions of H+e--{\textgreater}H-+h$\nu$ and H+H---{\textgreater}H2+e. The high-mass peak would then be O(10)Msolar.},

The dark matter is modeled using an analytical density profile that responds to changes in the peak gas density. We find that the gas can collapse to high densities despite the additional energy input from the dark matter. No objects supported purely by dark matter annihilation heating are formed in our simulations. However, we find that dark matter annihilation heating has a large effect on the evolution of the gas following the formation of the first protostar. Previous simulations without dark matter annihilation found that protostellar disks around Population III stars rapidly fragmented, forming multiple protostars that underwent mergers or ejections. When dark matter annihilation is included, however, these disks become stable to radii of 1000 AU or more. In the cases where fragmentation does occur, it is a wide binary that is formed.},

abstract = {We perform three-dimensional cosmological simulations to examine the growth of metal-free, Population III (Pop III) stars under radiative feedback. We begin our simulation at z=100 and trace the evolution of gas and dark matter until the formation of the first minihalo. We then follow the collapse of the gas within the minihalo up to densities of n = 10{\^{}}12 cm{\^{}}-3, at which point we replace the high-density particles with a sink particle to represent the growing protostar. We model the effect of Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation emitted by the protostar, and employ a ray-tracing scheme to follow the growth of the surrounding H II region over the next 5000 yr. We find that a disk assembles around the first protostar, and that radiative feedback will not prevent further fragmentation of the disk to form multiple Pop III stars. Ionization of neutral hydrogen and photodissociation of H{\_}2 by LW radiation leads to heating of the dense gas to several thousand Kelvin, and this warm region expands outward at the gas sound speed. Once the extent of this warm region becomes equivalent to the size of the disk, mass flow onto both the disk and the protostars is reduced by an order of magnitude. This occurs when the largest sink has grown to {\~{}} 20 M{\_}sol while the second sink has grown to 7 M{\_}sol, and we estimate the main sink will approach an asymptotic value of {\~{}} 30 M{\_}sol by the time it reaches the main sequence. Our simulation thus indicates that the most likely outcome is a massive Pop III binary. However, we simulate only one minihalo, and the statistical variation between minihaloes may be substantial. If Pop III stars were typically unable to grow to more than a few tens of solar masses, this would have important consequences for the occurence of pair-instability supernovae in the early Universe as well as the Pop III chemical signature in the oldest stars observable today.},

These stars expected to be very massive and in some cases they end their lives as the first supernovae (SNe). We explore the problem of whether star formation in low-mass dark halos ({\textless}=107 M sun) was triggered or suppressed by the SN feedback from neighboring star-forming halos. We take into consideration mainly two effects by the SN shock: one is the evacuation of gas components from the halos and the other is the promotion of H2 formation because of the enhanced ionization degree by shock heating. Combining above effects, we find that the star formation activities in the neighboring dark matter halos (M {\textless}= 107 M sun) are basically suppressed in case they are located close to the SN center, because of the gas evacuation effect. The critical distance within which the gas is blown away falls within the range {\~{}}0.3-1.5 kpc depending on the SN energy and the halo mass. In addition, we find there is very little window in the parameter space where star formation activities in dark halos are induced or promoted by neighboring SN.},

We show that photodissociation is significant in the least massive protogalaxies, but becomes less so as the protogalactic mass increases.

abstract = {Cosmic rays (CRs) are thought to provide an important source of ionization in the outermost and densest regions of protoplanetary disks; however, it is unknown to what degree they are physically present. As is observed in the solar system, stellar winds can inhibit the propagation of CRs within the circumstellar environment and subsequently into the disk. In this work, we explore the hitherto neglected effects of CR modulation by both stellar winds and magnetic field structures and study how these processes act to reduce disk ionization rates. We construct a two-dimensional protoplanetary disk model of a T-Tauri star system, focusing on ionization from stellar and interstellar FUV, stellar X-ray photons, and CRs. We show that stellar winds can power a heliosphere-like analog, i.e., a "T-Tauriosphere," diminishing CR ionization rates by several orders of magnitude at low to moderate CR energies (E CR {\textless}= 1 GeV). We explore models of both the observed solar wind CR modulation and a highly simplified estimate for "elevated" CR modulation as would be expected from a young T-Tauri star. In the former (solar analog) case, we estimate the ionization rate from galactic CRs to be $\zeta$CR {\~{}} (0.23-1.4) × 10-18 s-1. This range of values, which we consider to be the maximum CR ionization rate for the disk, is more than an order of magnitude lower than what is generally assumed in current models for disk chemistry and physics. In the latter elevated case, i.e., for a "T-Tauriosphere," the ionization rate by CRs is $\zeta$CR {\textless}{\~{}} 10-20 s-1, which is 1000 times smaller than the interstellar value. We discuss the implications of a diminished CR ionization rate on the gas physics by estimating the size of the resulting magnetorotational instability dead zones. Indeed, if winds are as efficient at CR modulation as predicted here, short-lived radionuclides (now extinct) would have provided the major source of ionization ($\zeta$RN {\~{}} 7.3 × 10-19 s-1) in the planet-forming zone of the young solar nebula.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that galaxies accrete most of their baryons via the cold mode, from streams with temperatures T{\~{}}10{\^{}}4-10{\^{}}5 K. At these temperatures, the streams should radiate primarily in the Lya line and have therefore been proposed as a model to power the extended, high-redshift objects known as Lya blobs and other high-redshift Lya sources. We introduce a new Lya radiative transfer code, aRT, and apply it to cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We address physical and numerical issues that are critical to making accurate predictions for the cooling luminosity, but that have been mostly neglected or treated simplistically so far. We highlight the importance of self-shielding and of properly treating sub-resolution models in simulations. Most existing simulations do not self-consistently incorporate these effects, which can lead to order-of-magnitude errors in the predicted cooling luminosity. Using a combination of post-processing ionizing radiative transfer and re-simulation techniques, we develop an approximation to the consistent evolution of the self-shielded gas. We quantify the dependence of the Lya cooling luminosity on halo mass at z=3 for the simplified problem of pure gas accretion. While cooling in massive halos (without additional energy input from star formation and AGN) is in principle sufficient to produce L{\_}alpha{\~{}}10{\^{}}43-10{\^{}}44 erg s{\^{}}-1 blobs, this requires including energy released in gas of density sufficient to form stars, but which is kept 100{\%} gaseous in our optimistic estimates. Excluding emission from such dense gas yields lower luminosities by up to one to two orders of magnitude at high masses, making it difficult to explain the observed Lya blobs with pure cooling. Resonant scattering produces diffuse Lya halos, even for centrally concentrated emission, and broad double peaked line profiles. [Abridged]},

abstract = {We investigate the environmental impact of the first active galactic nuclei that may have formed {\~{}}150 Myr after the big bang in low-mass {\~{}}106 Msolar minihaloes. Using ENZO, an adaptive-mesh refinement cosmological hydrodynamics code, we carry out three-dimensional simulations of the radiative feedback from `miniquasars' powered by intermediate-mass black holes. We follow the non-equilibrium multispecies chemistry of primordial gas in the presence of a point source of X-ray radiation, which starts shining in a rare high-$\sigma$ peak at z= 21 and emits a power-law spectrum in the 0.2-10 keV range. We find that, after one Salpeter time-scale, the miniquasar has heated up the simulation box to a volume-averaged temperature of 2800 K. The mean electron and H2 fractions are now 0.03 and 4 × 10-5: the latter is 20 times larger than the primordial value, and will delay the build-up of a uniform ultraviolet (UV) photodissociating background. The net effect of the X-rays is to reduce gas clumping in the intergalactic medium (IGM) by as much as a factor of 3. While the suppression of baryonic infall and the photoevaporation of some halo gas lower the gas mass fraction at overdensities $\delta$ in the range 20-2000, enhanced molecular cooling increases the amount of dense material at $\delta$ {\textgreater} 2000. In many haloes within the proximity of our miniquasar, the H2-boosting effect of X-rays is too weak to overcome heating, and the cold and dense gas mass actually decreases. We find little evidence for an entropy floor in gas at intermediate densities preventing gas contraction and H2 formation: we show, instead, that molecular cooling can affect the dynamics of baryonic material before it has fallen into the potential well of dark matter haloes and virialized. Overall, the radiative feedback from X-rays enhances gas cooling in lower-$\sigma$ peaks that are far away from the initial site of star formation, thus decreasing the clustering bias of the early pregalactic population, but does not appear to dramatically reverse or promote the collapse of pregalactic clouds as a whole.},

abstract = {Our current understanding of the physical processes of star formation is reviewed, with emphasis on processes occurring in molecular clouds like those observed nearby. The dense cores of these clouds are predicted to undergo gravitational collapse characterized by the runaway growth of a central density peak that evolves towards a singularity. As long as collapse can occur, rotation and magnetic fields do not change this qualitative behaviour. The result is that a very small embryonic star or protostar forms and grows by accretion at a rate that is initially high but declines with time as the surrounding envelope is depleted. Rotation causes some of the remaining matter to form a disk around the protostar, but accretion from protostellar disks is not well understood and may be variable. Most, and possibly all, stars form in binary or multiple systems in which gravitational interactions can play a role in redistributing angular momentum and driving episodes of disk accretion. Variable accretion may account for some peculiarities of young stars such as flareups and jet production, and protostellar interactions in forming systems of stars will also have important implications for planet formation. The most massive stars form in the densest environments by processes that are not yet well understood but may include violent interactions and mergers. The formation of the most massive stars may have similarities to the formation and growth of massive black holes in very dense environments.},

Studies of Gunn-Peterson (GP) absorption indicate a rapid increase in the neutral fraction of the intergalactic medium (IGM) from xHI {\textless} 10−4 at z ≤ 5.5, to xHI {\textgreater} 10−3, perhaps up to 0.1, at z∼6, while the large scale polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) implies a significant ionization fraction extending to higher redshifts, z∼11 ± 3. These results, as well as observations of galaxy populations, suggest that reionization is a process that begins as early as z∼14, and ends with the “percolation” phase at z∼6 to 8. Low luminosity star-forming galaxies are likely the dominant sources of reionizing photons. Future low-frequency radio telescopes will make direct measurements of HI 21-cm emission from the neutral IGM during the EoR, and measurements of secondary CMB temperature anisotropy will provide details of the dynamics of the reionized...},

abstract = {Observations of high-redshift supernovae (SNe) open a novel opportunity to study the massive star population in the early Universe. We study the detectability of superluminous SNe with upcoming optical and near-infrared (NIR) surveys. Our calculations are based on the cosmic star formation history, the SN occurence rate, the characteristic colour and the light curve of the SNe that are all calibrated by available observations. We show that 15-150 SNe up to z {\~{}} 4 will be discovered by the proposed Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam deep survey: 30 deg{\^{}}2 survey with 24.5 AB mag depth in z-band for 3 months. With its ultra-deep layer (3.5 deg{\^{}}2 with 25.6 AB mag depth in z-band for 4 months), the highest redshift can be extended to z {\~{}} 5. We further explore the detectability by upcoming NIR survey utilizing future satellites such as Euclid, WFIRST, and WISH. The wide-field NIR surveys are very efficient to detect high-redshift SNe. With a hypothetical deep NIR survey for 100 deg{\^{}}2 with 26 AB mag depth at 1-4 um, at least {\~{}} 50 SNe will be discovered at z{\textgreater}3 in half a year. The number of the detected SNe can place a strong constraint on the stellar initial mass function or its slope especially at the high-mass end. Superluminous SNe at high redshifts can be distinguished from other types of SNe by the long time-scale of their light curves in the observer's frame, the optical colours redder than other core-collapse SNe and the NIR colours redder than any other types of SNe.},

abstract = {We use two-dimensional and three-dimensional hybrid (kinetic ions-fluid electrons) simulations to investigate particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification at non-relativistic astrophysical shocks. We show that diffusive shock acceleration operates for quasi-parallel configurations (i.e., when the background magnetic field is almost aligned with the shock normal) and, for large sonic and Alfv{\'{e}}nic Mach numbers, produces universal power-law spectra vpropp -4, where p is the particle momentum. The maximum energy of accelerated ions increases with time, and it is only limited by finite box size and run time. Acceleration is mainly efficient for parallel and quasi-parallel strong shocks, where 10{\%}-20{\%} of the bulk kinetic energy can be converted to energetic particles and becomes ineffective for quasi-perpendicular shocks. Also, the generation of magnetic turbulence correlates with efficient ion acceleration and vanishes for quasi-perpendicular configurations. At very oblique shocks, ions can be accelerated via shock drift acceleration, but they only gain a factor of a few in momentum and their maximum energy does not increase with time. These findings are consistent with the degree of polarization and the morphology of the radio and X-ray synchrotron emission observed, for instance, in the remnant of SN 1006. We also discuss the transition from thermal to non-thermal particles in the ion spectrum (supra-thermal region) and we identify two dynamical signatures peculiar of efficient particle acceleration, namely, the formation of an upstream precursor and the alteration of standard shock jump conditions.},

abstract = {For the initial mass range (140 {\textless} M {\textless} 260 Msun) stars die in a thermonuclear runaway triggered by the pair-production instability. The supernovae they make can be remarkably energetic (up to {\~{}}10{\^{}}53 ergs) and synthesize considerable amounts of radioactive isotopes. Here we model the evolution, explosion, and observational signatures of representative pair-instability supernovae (PI SNe) spanning a range of initial masses and envelope structures. The predicted light curves last for hundreds of days and range in luminosity, from very dim to extremely bright, L {\~{}} 10{\^{}}44 ergs/s. The most massive events are bright enough to be seen at high redshift, but the extended light curve duration ({\~{}}1 year) -- prolonged by cosmological time-dilation -- may make it difficult to detect them as transients. An alternative approach may be to search for the brief and luminous outbreak occurring when the explosion shock wave reaches the stellar surface. Using a multi-wavelength radiation-hydrodynamics code we calculate that, in the rest-frame, the shock breakout transients of PI SNe reach luminosities of 10{\^{}}45-10{\^{}}46 ergs/s, peak at wavelengths {\~{}}30-170 Angstroms, and last for several hours. We explore the detectability of PI SNe emission at high redshift, and discuss how observations of the light curves, spectra, and breakout emission can be used to constrain the mass, radius, and metallicity of the progenitor.},

abstract = {We introduce a prescription for the luminosity from accreting protostars into smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation and apply the method to simulations of five primordial minihaloes generated from cosmological initial conditions. We find that accretion luminosity delays fragmentation within the haloes but does not prevent it. In haloes that slowly form a low number of protostars, the accretion luminosity can reduce the number of fragments that are formed before the protostars start ionizing their surroundings. However, haloes that rapidly form many protostars become dominated by dynamical processes, and the effect of accretion luminosity becomes negligible. Generally, the fragmentation found in the haloes is highly dependent on the initial conditions. Accretion luminosity does not substantially affect the accretion rates experienced by the protostars and is far less important than dynamical interactions, which can lead to ejections that effectively terminate the accretion. We find that the accretion rates on to the inner regions of the discs (20 au) around the protostars are highly variable, in contrast to the constant or smoothly decreasing accretion rates currently used in models of the pre-main-sequence evolution of Population III stars.},

These systems exhibit the lowest heavy-element abundance in the early universe and thus are potential fuel for the most metal poor halo stars. The detection of deuterium in one system at the level predicted by primordial nucleosynthesis provides a direct confirmation of the standard cosmological model.

abstract = {We explore the impact of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from massive Population III (Pop III) stars of 25, 40, 80 and 120Msolar on the subsequent Pop III star formation. In this paper, particular attention is paid to the dependence of radiative feedback on the mass of source Pop III star. UV radiation from the source star can work to impede the secondary star formation through the photoheating and photodissociation processes. Recently, Susa and Umemura have shown that the ionizing radiation alleviates the negative effect by H2-dissociating radiation from 120Msolar Pop III star, since an H2 shell formed ahead of an ionizing front can effectively shield H2-dissociating radiation. On the other hand, it is expected that the negative feedback by H2-dissociating radiation can be predominant if a source star is less massive, since a ratio of the H2-dissociating photon number to the ionizing photon number becomes higher. In order to investigate the radiative feedback effects from such less massive stars, we perform three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations, incorporating the radiative transfer effect of ionizing and H2-dissociating radiation. As a result, we find that if a source star is less massive than {\~{}}25Msolar, the ionizing radiation cannot suppress the negative feedback of H2-dissociating radiation. Therefore, the fate of the neighbouring clouds around such less massive stars is determined solely by the flux of H2-dissociating radiation from source stars. By making analytic estimates of H2 shell formation and its shielding effect, we derive the criteria for radiation hydrodynamic feedback depending on the source star mass.},

abstract = {We present a detailed and self-consistent modeling of the cosmic X-ray background (XRB) based on the most up-to-date X-ray luminosity functions (XLF) and evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The large body of observational results collected by soft (0.5-2 keV) and hard (2-10 keV) X-ray surveys are used to constrain at best the properties of the Compton-thin AGN population and its contribution to the XRB emission. The number ratio R between moderately obscured (Compton-thin) AGN and unobscured AGN is fixed by the comparison between the soft and hard XLFs, which suggests that R decreases from 4 at low luminosities to 1 at high luminosities. From the same comparison there is no clear evidence of an evolution of the obscured AGN fraction with redshift. The distribution of the absorbing column densities in obscured AGN is determined by matching the soft and hard source counts. A distribution rising towards larger column densities is able to reproduce the soft and hard AGN counts over about 6 dex in flux. The model also reproduces with excellent accuracy the fraction of obscured objects in AGN samples selected at different X-ray fluxes. The integrated emission of the Compton-thin AGN population is found to underestimate the XRB flux at about 30 keV, calling for an additional population of extremely obscured (Compton-thick) AGN. Since the number of Compton-thick sources required to fit the 30 keV XRB emission strongly depends on the spectral templates assumed for unobscured and moderately obscured AGN, we explored the effects of varying the spectral templates. In particular, in addition to the column density distribution, we also considered a distribution in the intrinsic powerlaw spectral indices of variable width. In our baseline model a Gaussian distribution of photon indices with mean {\textless} $\Gamma$ {\textgreater}=1.9 and dispersion $\sigma$$\Gamma$=0.2 is assumed. This increases the contribution of the Compton-thin AGN population to the 30 keV XRB intensity by {\~{}}30{\%} with respect to the case of null dispersion (i.e. a single primary AGN powerlaw with $\Gamma$=1.9) but is not sufficient to match the 30 keV XRB emission. Therefore a population of heavily obscured -Compton-thick- AGN, as large as that of moderately obscured AGN, is required to fit the residual background emission. Remarkably, the fractions of Compton-thick AGN observed in the Chandra Deep Field South and in the first INTEGRAL and Swift catalogs of AGN selected above 10 keV are in excellent agreement with the model predictions.},

The formation of very massive ({\$}\backslashgtrsim 250{\~{}}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}) stars is possible under weak UV feedback, whereas ordinary massive (a few {\$}\backslashtimes 10{\~{}}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}) stars form when UV feedback can efficiently halt the accretion. Weak UV feedback occurs in cases of variable accretion, in particular when repeated short accretion bursts temporarily exceed {\$}0.01{\~{}}M{\_}\backslashodot{\~{}}{\{}\backslashrm yr{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}, causing the protostar to inflate. In the bloated state, the protostar has low surface temperature and UV feedback is suppressed until the star eventually contracts, on a thermal adjustment timescale, to create an HII region. If the delay time between successive accretion bursts is sufficiently short, the protostar remains bloated for extended periods, initiating at most only short periods of UV feedback. Disk fragmentation does not necessarily reduce the final stellar mass. Quite the contrary, we find that disk fragmentation enhances episodic accretion as many fragments migrate inward and are accreted onto the star, thus allowing continued stellar mass growth under conditions of intermittent UV feedback. Our results suggest that, together with a number of ordinary massive stars, very massive stars can occur in significant numbers in the early universe. This may explain the recently reported peculiar abundance pattern of a Galactic metal-poor star, possibly the observational signature of very massive precursor primordial stars.},

We provide new yields for the main-sequence mass of MMS=13-50 Msolar and the explosion energy of E=(1-40)×1051 ergs to apply to chemical evolution studies. Our HN yields based on the mixing-fallback model of explosions reproduce the observed abundance patterns of extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars (-4{\textless}[Fe/H]{\textless}-3), while those of very metal-poor (VMP) stars (-3{\textless}[Fe/H]{\textless}-2) are reproduced by the normal SN yields integrated over the Salpeter initial mass function. Moreover, the observed trends of abundance ratios [X/Fe] against [Fe/H] with small dispersions for the EMP stars can be reproduced as a sequence resulting from the various combination of MMS and E. This is because we adopt the empirical relation that a larger amount of Fe is ejected by more massive HNe. Our results imply that the observed trends with small dispersions do not necessarily mean the rapid homogeneous mixing in the early Galactic halo at [Fe/H]{\textless}-3 but can be reproduced by the ``inhomogeneous'' chemical evolution model. In addition, we examine how the modifications of the distributions of the electron mole fraction Ye and the density in the presupernova models improve the agreement with observations.

abstract = {The evolution and explosion of metal-free stars with masses 10-100 M sun are followed, and their nucleosynthetic yields, light curves, and remnant masses determined. Such stars would have been the first to form after the big bang and may have left a distinctive imprint on the composition of the early universe. When the supernova yields are integrated over a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF), the resulting elemental abundance pattern is qualitatively solar, but with marked deficiencies of odd-Z elements with 7 {\textless}= Z {\textless}= 13. Neglecting the contribution of the neutrino wind from the neutron stars that they form, no appreciable abundances are made for elements heavier than germanium. The computed pattern compares favorably with what has been observed in metal-deficient stars with [Z] {\textless}{\~{}} -3. The amount of ionizing radiation from this generation of stars is {\~{}}2.16 MeV per baryon (4.15 B per M sun; where 1 B = 1 Bethe = 1051 erg) for a Salpeter IMF, and may have played a role in reionizing the universe. Neglecting rotation, most of the stars end their lives as blue supergiants and form supernovae with distinctive light curves resembling SN 1987A, but some produce primary nitrogen due to dredge-up and become red supergiants. These make brighter supernovae like typical Type IIp's. For the lower mass supernovae considered, the distribution of remnant masses clusters around typical modern neutron star masses, but above 20-30 M sun, with the value depending on explosion energy, black holes are copiously formed by fallback, with a maximum hole mass of {\~{}}40 M sun. A novel automated fitting algorithm is developed for determining optimal combinations of explosion energy, mixing, and IMF in the large model database to agree with specified data sets. The model is applied to the low-metallicity sample of Cayrel et al. and the two ultra-iron-poor stars HE0107-5240 and HE1327-2326. Best agreement with these very low metallicity stars is achieved with very little mixing, and none of the metal-deficient data sets considered show the need for a high-energy explosion component. In contrast, explosion energies somewhat less than 1.2 B seem to be preferred in most cases.},

abstract = {We investigate how radiative feedback from the first stars affects the assembly of the first dwarf galaxies. To this end we perform cosmological zoomed smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of a dwarf galaxy assembling inside a halo reaching a virial mass 10{\^{}}9 solar at z = 10. The simulations follow the non-equilibrium chemistry/cooling of primordial gas and the subsequent conversion of the gas into metal-free stars. To quantify the radiative feedback, we compare a simulation in which stars emit both molecular hydrogen dissociating and hydrogen/helium ionizing radiation with a simulation in which stars emit only molecular hydrogen dissociating radiation, and further with a simulation in which stars remain dark. Photodissociation and photoionization exert a strong negative feedback on the assembly of the galaxy inside the main minihalo progenitor. Gas condensation is strongly impeded, and star formation is strongly suppressed in comparison with the simulation in which stars remain dark. The feedback on the gas implies a suppression of the central dark matter densities in the minihalo progenitor by factors of up to a few, which is a significant deviation from the singular isothermal density profile characterizing the dark matter distribution inside the virial radius in the absence of radiative feedback. The evolution of gas densities, star formation rates, and the distribution of dark matter becomes insensitive to the inclusion of dissociating radiation in the late stages of the minihalo assembly, and it becomes insensitive to the inclusion of ionizing radiation once the minihalo turns into an atomically cooling galaxy.

abstract = {Observations of the high-redshift Universe with the 21 cm hyperfine line of neutral hydrogen promise to open an entirely new window onto the early phases of cosmic structure formation. Here we review the physics of the 21 cm transition, focusing on processes relevant at high redshifts, and describe the insights to be gained from such observations. These include measuring the matter power spectrum at z ∼ 50, observing the formation of the cosmic web and the first luminous sources, and mapping the reionization of the intergalactic medium. The epoch of reionization is of particular interest, because large HII regions will seed substantial fluctuations in the 21 cm background. We also discuss the experimental challenges involved in detecting this signal, with an emphasis on the Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. These increase rapidly toward low frequencies and are especially severe for the highest redshift applications. Assuming that these difficulties can be overcome, the redshifted 21 cm line will offer unique insight into the high-redshift Universe, complementing other probes but providing the only direct, three-dimensional view of structure formation from z ∼ 200 to 6. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Context. Un-evolved, very metal-poor stars are the most important tracers of the cosmic abundance of lithium in the early universe. Combining the standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis model with Galactic production through cosmic ray spallation, these stars at [Fe / H] {\textless} - 2 are expected to show an undetectably small 6Li / 7Li isotopic signature. Evidence to the contrary may necessitate an additional pre-galactic production source or a revision of the standard model of Big Bang nucleosynthesis. It would also cast doubts on Li depletion from stellar atmospheres as an explanation for the factor 3-5 discrepancy between the predicted primordial 7Li from the Big Bang and the observed value in metal-poor dwarf/turn-off stars. Aims: We revisit the isotopic analysis of four halo stars, two with claimed 6Li-detections in the literature, to investigate the influence of improved model atmospheres and line formation treatment. Methods: For the first time, a combined 3D, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) modelling technique for Li, Na, and Ca lines is utilised to constrain the intrinsic line-broadening and to determine the Li isotopic ratio. We discuss the influence of 3D NLTE effects on line profile shapes and assess the realism of our modelling using the Ca excitation and ionisation balance. Results: By accounting for NLTE line formation in realistic 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres, we can model the Li resonance line and other neutral lines with a consistency that is superior to LTE, with no need for additional line asymmetry caused by the presence of 6Li. Contrary to the results from 1D and 3D LTE modelling, no star in our sample has a significant (2$\sigma$) detection of the lighter isotope in NLTE. Over a large parameter space, NLTE modelling systematically reduces the best-fit Li isotopic ratios by up to five percentage points. As a bi-product, we also present the first ever 3D NLTE Ca and Na abundances of halo stars, which reveal significant departures from LTE. Conclusions: The observational support for a significant and non-standard 6Li production source in the early universe is substantially weakened by our findings.

As the neutral primordial gas is a poor radiator at temperatures T {\textless}= 104K, molecular hydrogen is needed for further cooling down to temperatures T {\~{}} 100K. The formation of molecular hydrogen is catalyzed by the presence of free electrons, which could be provided by the ionization due to an early population of cosmic rays (CRs). In order to investigate this possibility, we developed a code to study the effects of ionizing CRs on the thermal and chemical evolution of primordial gas. We found that CRs can provide enough free electrons needed for the formation of molecular hydrogen, and therefore can increase the cooling ability of such primordial gas under following conditions.

abstract = {We perform a large set of radiation hydrodynamic simulations of primordial star formation in a fully cosmological context. Our statistical sample of 100 First Stars shows that the first generation of stars has a wide mass distribution M popIII = 10 {\~{}} 1000 M ⊙. We first run cosmological simulations to generate a set of primordial star-forming gas clouds. We then follow protostar formation in each gas cloud and the subsequent protostellar evolution until the gas mass accretion onto the protostar is halted by stellar radiative feedback. The accretion rates differ significantly among the primordial gas clouds that largely determine the final stellar masses. For low accretion rates, the growth of a protostar is self-regulated by radiative feedback effects, and the final mass is limited to several tens of solar masses. At high accretion rates the protostar's outer envelope continues to expand, and the effective surface temperature remains low; such protostars do not exert strong radiative feedback and can grow in excess of 100 solar masses. The obtained wide mass range suggests that the first stars play a variety of roles in the early universe, by triggering both core-collapse supernovae and pair-instability supernovae as well as by leaving stellar mass black holes. We find certain correlations between the final stellar mass and the physical properties of the star-forming cloud. These correlations can be used to estimate the mass of the first star from the properties of the parent cloud or of the host halo without following the detailed protostellar evolution.},

abstract = {The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will enable observations of galaxies at redshifts z {\textgreater} 10 and hence allow to test our current understanding of structure formation at very early times. Previous work has shown that the very first galaxies inside halos with virial temperatures T {\textless} 10{\^{}}4 K and masses M {\textless} 10{\^{}}8 M{\_}sun at z {\textgreater} 10 are probably too faint, by at least one order of magnitude, to be detected even in deep exposures with JWST. The light collected with JWST may therefore be dominated by radiation from galaxies inside ten times more massive halos. We use cosmological zoomed smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to investigate the assembly of such galaxies and assess their observability with JWST. We compare two simulations that are identical except for the inclusion of non-equilibrium H/D chemistry and radiative cooling by molecular hydrogen. In both simulations a large fraction of the halo gas settles in two nested, extended gas disks which surround a compact massive gas core. The presence of molecular hydrogen allows the disk gas to reach low temperatures and to develop marked spiral structure but does not qualitatively change its stability against fragmentation. We post-process the simulated galaxies by combining idealized models for star formation with stellar population synthesis models to estimate the luminosities in nebular recombination lines as well as in the ultraviolet continuum. We demonstrate that JWST will be able to constrain the nature of the stellar populations in galaxies such as simulated here based on the detection of the He1640 recombination line. Extrapolation of our results to halos with masses both lower and higher than those simulated shows that JWST may find up to a thousand star-bursting galaxies in future deep exposures of the z {\textgreater} 10 universe.},

Although gravitational instabilities become strong, we find that fragmentation into binary or multiple systems occurs only when material falls in several times more rapidly than the canonical isothermal limit. The disk-to-star accretion rate is proportional to the infall rate and governed by gravitational torques generated by low-m spiral modes.

abstract = {We study for the first time the environment of massive black hole (BH) seeds (˜104-5 M⊙) formed via the direct collapse of pristine gas clouds in massive haloes (≥107 M⊙) at z {\textgreater} 6. Our model is based on the evolution of dark matter haloes within a cosmological N-body simulation, combined with prescriptions for the formation of BH along with both Population III (Pop III) and Population II (Pop II) stars. We calculate the spatially varying intensity of Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation from stars and identify the massive pristine haloes in which it is high enough to shut down molecular hydrogen cooling. In contrast to previous BH seeding models with a spatially constant LW background, we find that the intensity of LW radiation due to local sources, Jlocal, can be up to ˜106 times the spatially averaged background in the simulated volume and exceeds the critical value, Jcrit, for the complete suppression of molecular cooling, in some cases by four orders of magnitude. Even after accounting for possible metal pollution in a halo from previous episodes of star formation, we find a steady rise in the formation rate of direct collapse BHs (DCBHs) with decreasing redshift from 10-3 Mpc-3 z-1 at z = 12 to 10-2 Mpc-3 z-1 at z = 6. The onset of Pop II star formation at z ≈ 16 simultaneously marks the onset of the epoch of DCBH formation, as the increased level of LW radiation from Pop II stars is able to elevate the local levels of the LW intensity to Jlocal {\textgreater} Jcrit, while Pop III stars fail to do so at any time. The number density of DCBHs is sensitive to the number of LW photons and can vary by over an order of magnitude at z = 7 after accounting for reionization feedback. Haloes hosting DCBHs are more clustered than similar massive counterparts that do not host DCBHs, especially at redshifts z ≳ 10. Also, the DCBHs that form at z {\textgreater} 10 are found to reside in highly clustered regions, whereas the DCBHs formed around z ˜ 6 are more common. We also show that planned surveys with James Webb Space Telescope should be able to detect the supermassive stellar precursors of DCBHs.},

Firstly, we give a basic grounding in the fundamentals of SPH, showing how the equations of motion and energy can be self-consistently derived from the density estimate. We then show how to interpret these equations using the basic SPH interpolation formulae and highlight the subtle difference in approach between SPH and other particle methods. In doing so, we also critique several 'urban myths' regarding SPH, in particular the idea that one can simply increase the 'neighbour number' more slowly than the total number of particles in order to obtain convergence. We also discuss the origin of numerical instabilities such as the pairing and tensile instabilities. Finally, we give practical advice on how to resolve three of the main issues with SPMHD: removing the tensile instability, formulating dissipative terms for MHD shocks and enforcing the divergence constraint on the particles, and we give the current status of developments in this area. Accompanying the paper is the first public release of the NDSPMHD SPH code, a 1, 2 and 3 dimensional code designed as a testbed for SPH/SPMHD algorithms that can be used to test many of the ideas and used to run all of the numerical examples contained in the paper.},

Although the rates of these systems may be above those of NS-NS mergers, BH-NS and BH-BH systems are difficult to detect, and thusfar none have been observed. But the progenitors of BH-NS and BH-BH binary systems may have been observed, in the form of High-Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs). In this paper, we continue work studying these potential progenitors of these important gravitational wave sources. In the first two papers of the series, we have demonstrated that IC10 X-1 and NGC300 X-1 are direct progenitors of BH-BH systems and that Cyg X-1 may form, alas with a very low probability, a BH-NS system. Here, we analyze the Galactic binaries GX 301-2, Vela X-1, XTEJ1855-026, 4U1907+09, Cir X-1 and extra-galactic LMC X-1, LMC X-3, M33 X-1. In each case, we find that the future evolution will not allow the formation of a BH-NS nor a BH-BH system. Most of these binaries will soon merge in the common envelope phase, with a compact object sinking into a helium-rich core of a stellar companion. This "helium-merger" may be a progenitor for long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Based on the observed HMXB population, the rate of helium-mergers may make up a sizable fraction of long-duration GRBs. Due to this high number of potential GRB progenitors, a chance that a Galactic HMXB has caused one of the recent major mass extinction events is significant (10-20{\%}).},

abstract = {It is widely recognized that nucleosynthetic output of the first Population III supernovae was a catalyst defining the character of subsequent stellar generations. Most of the work on the earliest enrichment was carried out assuming that the first stars were extremely massive and that the associated supernovae were unusually energetic, enough to completely unbind the baryons in the host cosmic minihalo and disperse the synthesized metals into the intergalactic medium. Recent work, however, suggests that the first stars may in fact have been somewhat less massive, with a characteristic mass scale of a few tens of solar masses. We present a cosmological simulation following the transport of the metals synthesized in a Population III supernova assuming that it had an energy of 1051 erg, compatible with standard Type II supernovae. A young supernova remnant is inserted in the first star's relic H II region in the free expansion phase and is followed for 40 Myr employing adaptive mesh refinement and Lagrangian tracer particle techniques. The supernova remnant remains partially trapped within the minihalo, and the thin snowplow shell develops pronounced instability and fingering. Roughly half of the ejecta turn around and fall back toward the center of the halo, with 1{\%} of the ejecta reaching the center in {\~{}}30 kyr and 10{\%} in {\~{}}10 Myr. The average metallicity of the combined returning ejecta and the pristine filaments feeding into the halo center from the cosmic web is {\~{}}0.001-0.01 Z sun, but the two remain unmixed until accreting onto the central hydrostatic core that is unresolved at the end of the simulation. We conclude that if Population III stars had less extreme masses, they promptly enriched the host minihalos with metals and triggered Population II star formation.},

abstract = {We examine the fate of fast electrons (with energies E {\textgreater} 10eV) in a thermal gas of primordial composition. To follow their interactions with the background gas, we construct a Monte Carlo model that includes: (1) electron-electron scattering (which transforms the electron kinetic energy into heat), (2) collisional ionization of hydrogen and helium (which produces secondary electrons that themselves scatter through the medium) and (3) collisional excitation (which produces secondary photons, whose fates we also follow approximately). For the last process, we explicitly include all transitions to upper levels n {\textless}= 4, together with a well-motivated extrapolation to higher levels. In all cases, we use recent calculated cross-sections at E {\textless} 1keV and the Bethe approximation to extrapolate to higher energies. We compute the fractions of energy deposited as heat, ionization (tracking HI and the helium species separately) and excitation (tracking HI Ly$\alpha$ separately) under a broad range of conditions appropriate to the intergalactic medium. The energy deposition fractions depend on both the background ionized fraction and the electron energy but are nearly independent of the background density. We find good agreement with some, but not all, previous calculations at high energies. Electronic tables of our results are available.},

We follow the growth of isolated spherically symmetric density peaks starting from the linear perturbative regime. The initial parameters correspond to density peaks of various widths and heights in a cold dark matter cosmology. We use a one-dimensional spherical Lagrangian hydrodynamics code to follow the dynamical, thermal, and nonequilibrium chemical evolution of the gas. The system includes a collisionless dark matter component and a baryonic component composed of the nine species H, H{\^{}}-{\^{}}, H{\^{}}+{\^{}}, He, He{\^{}}+{\^{}}, He{\^{}}++{\^{}}, H{\_}2{\_}, H{\_}2{\_}{\^{}}+{\^{}}, and e{\^{}}-{\^{}}. All relevant chemical reactions between these species and their cooling mechanisms are included in the calculations. We explore the dependence of the dynamical evolution of the gas on two parameters: the initial mass scale and the initial overdensity of the system. We follow the evolution of the density, temperature, and abundance profiles within the cloud, assuming two types of central boundary conditions for the collisionless component: in one the infalling dark matter virializes through a reflection from a hard sphere, while in the other it accretes onto a central sink. We find that in both cases, radiative cooling by H{\_}2{\_} affects the collapse dynamics of the gas only after it has already virialized and become part of the bound object. Therefore, radiative cooling is unlikely to have triggered the initial collapse of perturbations at redshifts z {\textgreater} 10. Nevertheless, baryonic objects with masses well below the linear theory Jeans mass ({\textless}{\~{}}10{\^{}}3{\^{}} M{\_}sun{\_}) form at high redshifts because of shell crossing by the dark matter. Such objects could be the progenitors of a primordial population of high-mass stars in the intergalactic medium.},

abstract = {The 21-cm signal from the cosmic reionization epoch can shed light on the history of heating of the primordial intergalactic medium (IGM) at z{\~{}}30-10. It has been suggested that X-rays from the first accreting black holes could significantly heat the Universe at these early epochs. Here we propose another IGM heating mechanism associated with the first stars. As known from previous work, the remnants of powerful supernovae (SNe) ending the lives of massive Population III stars could readily expand out of their host dark matter minihalos into the surrounding IGM, aided by the preceeding photoevaporation of the halo's gas by the UV radiation from the progenitor star. We argue that during the evolution of such a remnant a significant fraction of the SN kinetic energy can be put into low-energy (E{\textless}30 MeV) cosmic rays that will eventually escape into the IGM. These subrelativistic cosmic rays could propagate through the Universe and heat the IGM by {\~{}}10-100 K by z{\~{}}15, before more powerful reionization/heating mechanisms associated with the first galaxies and quasars came into play. Future 21-cm observations could thus constrain the energetics of the first supernovae and provide information on the magnetic fields in the primordial IGM.},

abstract = {Population III (Pop III) stars can regulate star formation in the primordial Universe in several ways. They can ionize nearby haloes, and even if their ionizing photons are trapped by their own haloes, their Lyman-Werner (LW) photons can still escape and destroy H2 in other haloes, preventing them from cooling and forming stars. LW escape fractions are thus a key parameter in cosmological simulations of early reionization and star formation but have not yet been parametrized for realistic haloes by halo or stellar mass. To do so, we perform radiation hydrodynamical simulations of LW UV escape from 9-120 M⊙ Pop III stars in 105-107 M⊙ haloes with ZEUS-MP. We find that photons in the LW lines (i.e. those responsible for destroying H2 in nearby systems) have escape fractions ranging from 0 to 85 per cent. No LW photons escape the most massive halo in our sample, even from the most massive star. Escape fractions for photons elsewhere in the 11.18-13.6 eV energy range, which can be redshifted into the LW lines at cosmological distances, are generally much higher, being above 60 per cent for all but the least massive stars in the most massive haloes. We find that shielding of H2 by neutral hydrogen, which has been neglected in most studies to date, produces escape fractions that are up to a factor of 3 smaller than those predicted by H2 self-shielding alone.},

abstract = {The formation of the first stars, also known as Population III (Pop III), marked a pivotal point in the universe's evolution from relative smoothness and homogeneity to its current highly structured state. In this dissertation we study key aspects of Pop III star formation. We utilize three-dimensional cosmological simulations to follow the evolution of gas and DM from z ∼100 until the first minihalo forms. Once the gas infalls toward the center of the minihalo and condenses, we implement the ‘sink particle' method to represent regions that will form a star, and we follow the evolution of the metal-free, star-forming gas for many free-fall times. A disk forms around the initial Pop III star and fragments to form secondary stars with a range of masses (1 - 50 M?). This is markedly different from the previous paradigm of one single, massive star forming per minihalo. Using a ray-tracing technique, we also examine the effect of radiative feedback on protostellar growth and disk frag- mentation. This feedback will not prevent the formation of secondary stars within the disk, but will reduce the final mass reached by the largest Pop III star. Measuring the angular momentum of the gas that falls onto the sink regions, we also find that the more massive Pop III stars accrete sufficient angular momentum to rotate at nearly break-up speeds, and can potentially end their lives as collapsar gamma-ray bursts or hypernovae. We furthermore numerically examine the recently discovered relative streaming motions be- tween dark matter and baryons, originating from the era of recombination. Relative streaming will slightly delay the redshift at which Pop III stars first form, but will otherwise have little impact on Pop III star formation and the history of reionization. We finally evaluate the possible effect of a cosmic ray (CR) background generated by the supernova deaths of massive Pop III stars. A sufficiently large CR background could indirectly enhance the H2 cooling within the affected minihalos. The resulting lower temperatures would lead to a reduced characteristic stellar mass (∼ 10M?), providing another possible pathway to form low-mass Pop III stars.},

abstract = {We present a series of simulations of the fragmentation of a molecular cloud, leading to the formation of a cluster of protostellar cores. We use Gaussian initial conditions with a power spectrum P(k){\~{}}k-2, assume an isothermal equation of state, and neglect turbulence and magnetic fields. The purpose of these simulations is to address a specific numerical problem called artificial fragmentation, which plagues simulations of cloud fragmentation. We argue that this is a serious problem, and that the only reasonable and practical way to address it within the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) algorithm is to use a technique called particle splitting. We performed three simulations, with Ngen=0, 1, and 2 levels of particle splitting. All simulations start up with 643 SPH particles, but their effective resolutions correspond to 643, 1283, and 2563 particles, respectively. The third simulation properly resolves the Jeans mass throughout the entire system, at all times, thus preventing artificial fragmentation. The high resolution of our simulations results in the formation of a large number of protostellar cores, nearly 3000 for the largest simulation. The final mass distribution of cores is lognormal, and the distribution shifts down in mass as the resolution improves. The width of the distribution is about 1.5 (e.g., a factor of 30 in the mass), and the low-mass edge of the distribution corresponds to the lowest core mass that the code can resolve. This result differs from previous claims of a relationship between the mean of the distribution and the initial Jeans mass.},

abstract = {We investigate the star formation process in the primordial environment in the presence of radiative feedback from other Population III stars that formed earlier. In this paper, we focus our attention on the effects of photodissociative radiation, leading toward a full understanding of the radiative feedback effects. We perform three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations on this issue, as well as analytic estimates, paying special attention to the self-shielding effect and the dynamics of the star-forming cloud. As a result, we find that the ignition timing of the source star is crucial. If the ignition is later than the epoch when the central density of the collapsing cloud exceeds {\~{}}103-104 cm-3, the collapse cannot be reversed, even if the source star is located at {\textless}{\~{}}100 pc. The uncertainty of the critical density comes from the variety of initial conditions of the collapsing cloud. We also find the analytic criterion for a cloud to collapse with a given central density, temperature, and Lyman-Werner-band flux that irradiates the cloud. Although we focus on the radiation from neighboring stars, this result can also be applied to the effects of the diffuse Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation field that is expected to be built up prior to the reionization of the universe. We find that self-gravitating clouds can easily self-shield from diffuse LW radiation and continue their collapse for densities larger than {\~{}}103 cm-3.},

abstract = {Energetic particles, traditionally called Cosmic Rays, were discovered nearly a hundred years ago, and their origin is still uncertain. Their main constituents are the normal nuclei as in the standard cosmic abundances of matter, with some enhancements for the heavier elements; there are also electrons, positrons and anti-protons. Today we also have information on isotopic abundances, which show some anomalies, as compared with the interstellar medium. And there is antimatter, but no anti-nuclei. The known spectrum extends over energies from a few hundred MeV to 300 EeV (= 3 x 1020eV), and shows few clear spectral signatures: There is a small spectral break near 5 x 10 15 eV, commonly referred to as the knee, where the spectrum turns down; there is another spectral break near 3 x 1018 eV, usually called the ankle, where the spectrum turns up again. Up to the ankle the cosmic rays are usually interpreted as originating from supernova explosions, i.e. those cosmic ray particles are thought to be Galactic in origin; however, the details are not clear. We do not know what the origin of the knee is, and what physical processes can give rise to particle energies in the energy range from the knee to the ankle. The particles beyond the ankle have to be extragalactic, it is usually assumed, because the Larmor radii in the Galactic magnetic field are too large; this argument could be overcome if those particles were very heavy nuclei as Fe, an idea which appears to be inconsistent, however, with the airshower data immediately above the energy of the ankle. Due to interaction with the cosmic microwave background (CMB), a relic of the Big Bang, there is a strong cut-off expected near 50 EeV (= 5 x 1019 eV), which is, however, not seen; this expected cutoff is called the GZK-cutoff after its discoverers, Greisen, Zatsepin and Kuzmin. The spectral index $\alpha$ is near 2.7 below the knee, near 3.1 above the knee, and again near 2.7 above the ankle, where this refers to a differential spectrum of the form E{\^{}}-$\alpha$ in numbers. The high energy cosmic rays beyond the GZK-cutoff are the challenge to interpret. We will describe the various approaches to understand the origin and physics of cosmic rays.},

abstract = {The initial mass function (IMF) of metal-free stars that form in the initial starburst of massive (virial temperatures {\textgreater}{\~{}}104 K) metal-free protogalaxies is studied. In particular, we focus on the effect of H2 photodissociation by preexisting stars on the fragmentation mass scale, presumedly determined by the Jeans mass at the end of the initial free-fall phase, i.e., at the so-called loitering phase, characterized by the temporary temperature minimum. Photodissociation diminishes the Jeans mass at the loitering phase, thereby reducing the fragmentation mass scale of primordial clouds. Thus, in a given cloud, far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation from the first star, which is supposedly very massive ({\~{}}103Msolar), reduces the mass scale for subsequent fragmentation. Through a series of similar processes the IMF for metal-free stars is established. If FUV radiation exceeds a threshold level, the star-forming clumps collapse solely through atomic cooling. Correspondingly, the fragmentation scale drops discontinuously from a few × 10Msolar to subsolar scales. In compact clouds ({\textless}{\~{}}1.6 kpc for clouds of gas mass 108Msolar), this level of radiation field is attained and subsolar-mass stars are formed, even in a metal-free environment. Consequently, the IMF becomes bimodal, with peaks at a few tenths Msolar and a few × 10 Msolar. The high-mass portion of the IMF, $\xi$high(m*), is found to be a very steep function of the stellar mass m*, $\xi$high(m*){\~{}}m-5*. Therefore, the typical mass scale of metal-free stars is significantly smaller than that of the very first stars. In an appendix we study the thermal instability in collapsing primordial prestellar cores and discuss why the thermal instability occurring during the three-body H2 formation does not appear to manifest itself in causing further fragmentation of such cores.},

Sink particles allow the process of gas hydrodynamics and accretion on to cluster stars to be followed for ˜4 Myr corresponding to multiple local free-fall times. At metallicities at least 10-3 Z⊙, gas is able to reach the cosmic microwave background temperature floor and fragment pervasively resulting in a stellar cluster of size ˜1 pc and total mass ˜1000 M⊙. The masses of individual sink particles vary, but are typically ˜100 M⊙, consistent with the Jeans mass at TCMB, though some solar mass fragments are also produced. Below 10-4 Z⊙, fragmentation is strongly suppressed on scales greater than 0.01 pc and total stellar mass is lower by a factor of ˜3 than in the higher metallicity simulations. The sink particle accretion rates, and thus their masses, are determined by the mass of the gravitationally unstable gas cloud and prolonged gas accretion over many Myr, exhibiting features of both monolithic collapse and competitive accretion. Even considering possible dust-induced fragmentation that may occur at higher densities, the formation of a bona fide stellar cluster seems to require metal line cooling and metallicities of at least ˜10-3 Z⊙.},

We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of halo mass, of initial density fluctuation spectrum, and of the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fit over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation which reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results to previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, which allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

abstract = {The cosmic dark ages ended a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, when the first stars began to fill the universe with new light. It has generally been argued that these stars formed in isolation and were extremely massive - perhaps 100 times as massive as the Sun. We here use a series of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations performed with the moving mesh code AREPO to show that this view may require revision. We follow the collapse of five independent minihalos from cosmological initial conditions, through the runaway condensation of their central gas clouds, to the formation of the first protostar, and beyond for a further 1000 years. During this latter accretion phase, we represent the optically thick regions of protostars by sink particles. Gas accumulates rapidly in the circumstellar disk around the first protostar, fragmenting vigorously to produce a small group of protostars. After an initial burst, gravitational instability recurs periodically, forming additional protostars with masses ranging from {\~{}}0.1 to 10 M{\_}sun. Although the shape, multiplicity, and normalization of the protostellar mass function depend on the details of the sink-particle algorithm, fragmentation into protostars with diverse masses occurs in all cases, with low-mass objects occasionally being ejected through gravitational slingshot effects. Depending on the efficiency of later accretion and merging, Population III stars may enter the main sequence in clusters and with much more diverse masses than is commonly assumed. A few may even survive to the present day.},

abstract = {In the near future, measurements of metal absorption features in the intergalactic medium (IGM) will become an important constraint on models of the formation and evolution of the earliest galaxies, the properties of the first stars, and the reionization and enrichment of the IGM. The first measurement of a metal abundance in the IGM at a redshift approaching the epoch of reionization already offers intriguing hints. Between z=5.8 and 4.7 (a 0.3 Gyr interval only 1 Gyr after the big bang), the measured density of CIV absorbers in the IGM increased by a factor of {\~{}} 3.5 (Ryan-Weber et al. 2009; Becker, Rauch {\&} Sargent 2009). If these values prove to be accurate, they pose two puzzles: (1) The total amount of CIV at z=5.8 implies too little star formation to reionize the IGM by z=6 or to match the WMAP electron scattering optical depth (tau). (2) The rapid growth from z = 6-5 is faster than the buildup of stellar mass or the increase in the star formation rate density over the same interval. We show that a delay of {\~{}} 0.4-0.7 Gyr between the instantaneous production of ionizing photons and the later production of metal absorption features (added to the delay due to stellar lifetimes) can provide the full explanation for both puzzles. We calculate the delay in metal production due to finite stellar lifetimes alone and find that it is too short to explain the rapid CIV density increase. The additional delay could naturally be explained as the result of {\~{}} 200 km/s outflows carrying carbon to distances of {\~{}} 100 kpc, the typical distance between galaxies and CIV absorbers in enrichment simulations, and the typical outflow or absorption region scale observed at z {\~{}} 2-3.},

abstract = {With the first metal enrichment by Population III (Pop III) supernovae (SNe), the formation of the first metal-enriched, Pop II stars becomes possible. In turn, Pop III star formation and early metal enrichment are slowed by the high-energy radiation emitted by Pop II stars. Thus, through the SNe and radiation they produce, Pops II and III co-evolve in the early Universe, one regulated by the other. We present large (4 Mpc)3, high-resolution cosmological simulations in which we self-consistently model early metal enrichment and the stellar radiation responsible for the destruction of the coolants (H2 and HD) required for Pop III star formation. We find that the molecule-dissociating stellar radiation produced both locally and over cosmological distances reduces the Pop III star formation rate at z ≳ 10 by up to an order of magnitude, to a rate per comoving volume of ≲ 10- 4 M⊙ yr- 1 Mpc- 3, compared to the case in which this radiation is not included. However, we find that the effect of Lyman-Werner (LW) feedback is to enhance the amount of Pop II star formation. We attribute this to the reduced rate at which gas is blown out of dark matter haloes by SNe in the simulation with LW feedback, which results in larger reservoirs for metal-enriched star formation. Even accounting for metal enrichment, molecule-dissociating radiation and the strong suppression of low-mass galaxy formation due to reionization at z ≲ 10, we find that Pop III stars are still formed at a rate of ˜ 10- 5 M⊙ yr- 1 Mpc- 3 down to z ˜ 6. This suggests that the majority of primordial pair-instability SNe that may be uncovered in future surveys will be found at z ≲ 10. We also find that the molecule-dissociating radiation emitted from Pop II stars may destroy H2 molecules at a high enough rate to suppress gas cooling and allow for the formation of supermassive primordial stars which collapse to form ˜ 105 M⊙ black holes.},

These effects were predetermined by the mass distribution of the first stars, which is thought to have been fixed by a complex interplay of gas accretion and protostellar radiation. We performed radiation-hydrodynamics simulations that followed the growth of a primordial protostar through to the early stages as a star with thermonuclear burning. The circumstellar accretion disk was evaporated by ultraviolet radiation from the star when its mass was 43 times that of the Sun. Such massive primordial stars, in contrast to the often-postulated extremely massive stars, may help explain the fact that there are no signatures of the pair-instability supernovae in abundance patterns of metal-poor stars in our galaxy.},

abstract = {We present the results of three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations of the formation and evolution of early H II/He III regions around the first stars. Cooling and recollapse of the gas in the relic H II region is also followed in a full cosmological context, until second-generation stars are formed. We first carry out ray-tracing simulations of ionizing radiation transfer from the first star. Hydrodynamics is directly coupled with photoionization heating as well as radiative and chemical cooling. The photoionized hot gas is evacuated out of the host halo at a velocity of {\~{}}30 km s-1. This radiative feedback effect quenches further star formation within the halo for over tens to a hundred million years. We show that the thermal and chemical evolution of the photoionized gas in the relic H II region is remarkably different from that of a neutral primordial gas. Efficient molecular hydrogen production in the recombining gas enables it to cool to {\~{}}100 K, where fractionation of HD/H2 occurs. The gas further cools by HD line cooling down to a few tens of kelvins. Interestingly, at high redshifts (z{\textgreater}10), the minimum gas temperature is limited by that of the cosmic microwave background with TCMB=2.728(1+z). The gas cloud experiences runaway collapse when its mass is {\~{}}40 Msolar, which is significantly smaller than a typical clump mass of {\~{}}200-300 Msolar for early primordial gas clouds. We argue that massive, rather than very massive, primordial stars may form in the relic H II region. Such stars might be responsible for early metal enrichment of the interstellar medium from which recently discovered hyper-metal-poor stars were born.},

abstract = {Cosmic-ray and X-ray heating are derived from the electron energy-loss calculations of Dalgarno, Yan, and Liu for hydrogen-helium gas mixtures. These authors treated the heating from elastic scattering and collisional de-excitation of rotationally excited hydrogen molecules. Here we consider the heating that can arise from all ionization and excitation processes, with particular emphasis on the reactions of cosmic-ray and X-ray generated ions with the heavy neutral species, which we refer to as chemical heating. In molecular regions, chemical heating dominates and can account for 50{\%} of the energy expended in the creation of an ion pair. The heating per ion pair ranges in the limit of negligible electron fraction from {\~{}}4.3 eV for diffuse atomic gas to {\~{}}13 eV for the moderately dense regions of molecular clouds and to {\~{}}18 eV for the very dense regions of protoplanetary disks. An important general conclusion of this study is that cosmic-ray and X-ray heating depends on the physical properties of the medium, i.e., on the molecular and electron fractions, the total density of hydrogen nuclei, and, to a lesser extent, on the temperature. It is also noted that chemical heating, the dominant process for cosmic-ray and X-ray heating, plays a role in UV irradiated molecular gas.},

Methods: We present here the second half of an ESO Large Programme, which exploits the unique combination of area and sensitivity provided in the near-IR by the camera Hawk-I at the VLT. We have obtained {\~{}} 30 observing hours with Hawk-I in the Y-band of two high galactic latitude fields. We combined the Y-band data with deep J and K Hawk-I observations, as well as FORS1/FORS2 U, B, V, R, I, and Z observations to select z-drop galaxies with Z-Y{\textgreater}1, no optical detection, and flat Y-J and Y-K colour terms. Results: We detect eight high-quality candidates in the magnitude range Y = 25.5-26.5 that we add to the z-drop candidates selected in two Hawk-I pointings over the GOODS-South field. We use this full sample of 15 objects found in {\~{}}161 arcmin2 of our survey to constrain the average physical properties and the evolution of the number density of z {\~{}} 7 LBGs. A stacking analysis yields a best-fit SED with photometric redshift z = 6.85-0.15+0.20 and an E(B-V) = 0.05-0.05+0.15. We compute a binned estimate of the z {\~{}} 7 LF and explore the effects of photometric scatter and model uncertainties on the statistical constraints. After accounting for the expected incompleteness through MonteCarlo simulations, we strengthen our previous finding that a Schechter luminosity function constant from z = 6 to z = 7 is ruled out at a ⪆99{\%} confidence level, even including the effects of cosmic variance. For galaxies brighter than M1500 = -19.0, we derive a luminosity density $\rho$UV = 1.5-0.8+2.1 × 1025 erg s-1 Hz-1 Mpc-3, implying a decrease by a factor 3.5 from z = 6 to z ≃ 6.8. We find that under standard assumptions, the emission rate of ionizing photons coming from UV bright galaxies is lower by at least a factor of two than the value required for reionization. Finally, we exploit deep Hawk-I J and K band observations to derive an upper limit on the number density of M1500 ⪉ -22.0 LBGs at z {\~{}} 8 (Y-dropouts).},

abstract = {We study the effects of WIMP dark matter (DM) annihilations on the thermal and chemical evolution of the gaseous clouds where the first generation of stars in the Universe is formed. We follow the collapse of the gas inside a typical halo virializing at very high redshift, from well before virialization until a stage where the heating from DM annihilations exceeds the gas cooling rate. The DM energy input is estimated by inserting the energy released by DM annihilations (as predicted by an adiabatic contraction of the original DM profile) in a spherically symmetric radiative transfer scheme. In addition to the heating effects of the energy absorbed, we include its feedback upon the chemical properties of the gas, which is critical to determine the cooling rate in the halo, and hence the fragmentation scale and Jeans mass of the first stars. We find that DM annihilation does alter the free electron and especially the H2 fraction when the gas density is n{\textgreater}{\~{}} 10{\^{}}4 cm{\^{}}-3, for our fiducial parameter values. However, even if the change in the H2 abundance and the cooling efficiency of the gas is large (sometimes exceeding a factor 100), the effects on the temperature of the collapsing gas are far smaller (a reduction by a factor {\textless}{\~{}}1.5), since the gas cooling rate depends very strongly on temperature: then, the fragmentation mass scale is reduced only slightly, hinting towards no dramatic change in the initial mass function of the first stars.},

abstract = {The first stars form in dark matter halos of masses {\~{}}106 Msolar as suggested by an increasing number of numerical simulations. Radiation feedback from these stars expels most of the gas from the shallow potential well of their surrounding dark matter halos. We use cosmological adaptive mesh refinement simulations that include self-consistent Population III star formation and feedback to examine the properties of assembling early dwarf galaxies. Accurate radiative transport is modeled with adaptive ray tracing. We include supernova explosions and follow the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium. The calculations focus on the formation of several dwarf galaxies and their progenitors. In these halos, baryon fractions in 108 Msolar halos decrease by a factor of 2 with stellar feedback and by a factor of 3 with supernova explosions. We find that radiation feedback and supernova explosions increase gaseous spin parameters up to a factor of 4 and vary with time. Stellar feedback, supernova explosions, and H2 cooling create a complex, multiphase interstellar medium whose densities and temperatures can span up to 6 orders of magnitude at a given radius. The pair-instability supernovae of Population III stars alone enrich the halos with virial temperatures of 104 K to approximately 10-3 of solar metallicity. We find that 40{\%} of the heavy elements resides in the intergalactic medium (IGM) at the end of our calculations. The highest metallicity gas exists in supernova remnants and very dilute regions of the IGM.},

@article{GloverBrand2003,
abstract = {The first generation of stars (commonly known as population III) are expected to form in low-mass protogalaxies in which molecular hydrogen is the dominant coolant. Radiation from these stars will rapidly build up an extragalactic ultraviolet (UV) background capable of photodissociating H2, and it is widely believed that this background will suppress further star formation in low-mass systems. However, star formation will also produce an extragalactic X-ray background. This X-ray background, by increasing the fractional ionization of protogalactic gas, promotes H2 formation and reduces the effectiveness of ultraviolet feedback. In this paper, we examine which of these backgrounds has the dominant effect. Using a simple model for the growth of the UV and X-ray backgrounds, together with a detailed one-dimensional model of protogalactic chemical evolution, we examine the effects of the X-ray backgrounds produced by a number of likely source models. We show that in several cases, the resulting X-ray background is strong enough to offset UV photodissociation in large H2-cooled protogalaxies. On the other hand, small protogalaxies (those with virial temperatures Tvir {\textless} 2000 K) remain dominated by the UV background in all of the models we examine. We also briefly investigate the effects of the X-ray background upon the thermal and chemical evolution of the diffuse intergalactic medium.},

We find that the primordial protostars are extended 'fluffy' objects for the bulk of their pre-main-sequence lifetimes. Accretion luminosity feedback from such objects is high, but, as shown in previous work, it has a minimal effect on the star cluster. The extended radii of the protostars, combined with the observation of close encounters in the simulations, suggest that mergers will occur in such systems. Furthermore, mass transfer between close protostellar binaries with extended radii could lead to massive tight binaries, which are a possible progenitor of gamma-ray bursts.},

abstract = {We study the benefits and limits of parallelised Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling in cosmology. MCMC methods are widely used for the estimation of cosmological parameters from a given set of observations and are typically based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Some of the required calculations can however be computationally intensive, meaning that a single long chain can take several hours or days to calculate. In practice, this can be limiting, since the MCMC process needs to be performed many times to test the impact of possible systematics and to understand the robustness of the measurements being made. To achieve greater speed through parallelisation, MCMC algorithms need to have short autocorrelation times and minimal overheads caused by tuning and burn-in. The resulting scalability is hence influenced by two factors, the MCMC overheads and the parallelisation costs. In order to efficiently distribute the MCMC sampling over thousands of cores on modern cloud computing infrastructure, we developed a Python framework called CosmoHammer which embeds emcee, an implementation by Foreman-Mackey et al. (2012) of the affine invariant ensemble sampler by Goodman and Weare (2010). We test the performance of CosmoHammer for cosmological parameter estimation from cosmic microwave background data. While Metropolis-Hastings is dominated by overheads, CosmoHammer is able to accelerate the sampling process from a wall time of 30 h on a dual core notebook to 16 min by scaling out to 2048 cores. Such short wall times for complex datasets open possibilities for extensive model testing and control of systematics.},

abstract = {Galactic-scale winds are a generic feature of massive galaxies with high star formation rates across a broad range of redshifts. Despite their importance, a detailed physical understanding of what drives these mass loaded global flows has remained elusive. In this paper, we explore the dynamical impact of cosmic rays (CRs) by performing the first three-dimensional, adaptive mesh refinement simulations of an isolated starbursting galaxy that includes a basic model for the production, dynamics and diffusion of galactic CRs. We find that including CRs naturally leads to robust, massive, bipolar outflows from our 1012 M⊙ halo, with a mass loading factor dot{\{}M{\}}/SFR = 0.3 for our fiducial run. Other reasonable parameter choices led to mass loading factors above unity. The wind is multiphase and is accelerated to velocities well in excess of the escape velocity. We employ a two-fluid model for the thermal gas and relativistic CR plasma and model a range of physics relevant to galaxy formation, including radiative cooling, shocks, self-gravity, star formation, supernovae feedback into both the thermal and CR gas and isotropic CR diffusion. Injecting CRs into star-forming regions can provide significant pressure support for the interstellar medium (ISM), suppressing star formation and thickening the disc. We find that CR diffusion plays a central role in driving superwinds, rapidly transferring long-lived CRs from the highest density regions of the disc to the ISM at large, where their pressure gradient can smoothly accelerate the gas out of the disc.},

Several present-day distributions of the orbital elements are derived. For systems with M(2)/M(1) above 0.1 in the nearby G-dwarf sample, the following results are obtained: (1) The orbital period distribution is unimodal and can be approximated by a Gaussian-type relation with a median period of 180 yrs. (2) The short binaries are circularized up to orbital periods of about 11 d due to the tidal evolution effects - a result compatible with the mean age of the Galactic disk. (3) The tight binaries not affected by tidal effects (in the range between 11 and 1000 d) may reflect the initial binary formation process, and they have a mean eccentricity of 0.31 +/-0.04. For systems with M(2)/M(1) not greater than 0.1, the proportion of brown dwarf companions among the IAU velocity standards is estimated at 10 percent of the primaries, a value in good agreement with that found in the G-dwarf sample.},

abstract = {I review the excursion set theory (EST) of dark matter halo formation and clustering. I recount the Press-Schechter argument for the mass function of bound objects and review the derivation of the Press-Schechter mass function in EST. The EST formalism is powerful and can be applied to numerous problems. I review the EST of halo bias and the properties of void regions. I spend considerable time reviewing halo growth in the EST. This section culminates with descriptions of two Monte Carlo methods for generating halo mass accretion histories. In the final section, I emphasize that the standard EST approach is the result of several simplifying assumptions. Dropping these assumptions can lead to more faithful predictions and a more versatile formalism. One such assumption is the constant height of the barrier for nonlinear collapse. I review implementations of the excursion set approach with arbitrary barrier shapes. An application of this is the now well-known improvement to standard EST that follows from the ellipsoidal-collapse barrier. Additionally, I emphasize that the statement that halo accretion histories are independent of halo environments is a simplifying assumption, rather than a prediction of the theory. I review the method for constructing correlated random walks of the density field in more general cases. I construct a simple toy model with correlated walks and I show that excursion set theory makes a qualitatively simple and general prediction for the relation between halo accretion histories and halo environments: regions of high density preferentially contain late-forming halos and conversely for regions of low density. I conclude with a brief discussion of this prediction in the context of recent numerical studies of the environmental dependence of halo properties. (Abridged)},

The abundance distribution after the explosion and the angular dependence of the yield are obtained for the models with high and low energy deposition rates $\backslash$dot{\{}E{\}}{\_}dep=120×10{\^{}}{\{}51{\}} erg s-1 and 1.5 × 1051 erg s-1, respectively. The ejection of Fe-peak products and the fallback of unprocessed materials in the jet-induced SNe account for the abundance patterns of the extremely metal-poor stars.

Furthermore, I compare the yield of the jet-induced explosion with that of the spherical explosion and confirm the ejection and fallback in the jet-induced explosion is almost equivalent to the "mixing-fallback" in spherical explosions. In contrast to the spherical models, however, the high-entropy environment is realized in the jet-induced explosion and thus [(Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Co, Zn)/Fe] are enhanced.

abstract = {We show that the universe was reionized twice, first at z{\~{}}15-16 and again at z{\~{}}6. Such an outcome appears inevitable when normalizing to two well-determined observational measurements, namely, the epoch of the final cosmological reionization at z{\~{}}6 and the density fluctuations at z{\~{}}6, which in turn are tightly constrained by Ly$\alpha$ forest observations at z{\~{}}3. These two observations most importantly fix the product of star formation efficiency and the ionizing photon escape fraction from galaxies at high redshift. The only major assumption made is that the initial mass function of metal-free, Population III stars is top-heavy. To the extent that the relative star formation efficiencies in gaseous minihalos with H2 cooling and large halos with atomic cooling at high redshift are unknown, the primary source for the first reionization is still uncertain. If star formation efficiency in minihalos is at least 10{\%} of that in large halos, then Population III stars in the minihalos may be largely responsible for the first reionization; otherwise, the first reionization will be attributable largely to Population III stars in large halos. In the former case, H2 cooling in minihalos is necessarily efficient. We show that gas in minihalos can be cooled efficiently by H2 molecules and that star formation can continue to take place largely unimpeded throughout the first reionization period, as long as gas is able to accumulate in them. This comes about thanks to two new mechanisms for generating a high X-ray background during the Population III era put forth here, namely, X-ray emission from the cooling energy of Population III supernova blast waves and that from miniquasars powered by Population III black holes. Consequently, H2 formation in the cores of minihalos is significantly induced to be able to counteract the destruction by Lyman-Werner photons produced by the same Population III stars. In addition, an important process for producing a large number of H2 molecules in relic H II regions of high-redshift galaxies, first pointed out by Ricotti, Gnedin, {\&} Shull in 2001, is quantified here for Population III galaxies. It is shown that H2 molecules produced by this process may overwhelm the dissociating effects of the Lyman-Werner photons produced by stars in the same Population III galaxies. As a result, the Lyman-Werner background may not build up in the first place during the Population III era. The long cosmological reionization and reheating history is complex. From z{\~{}}30, Population III stars gradually heat up and ionize the intergalactic medium, completing the first reionization at z{\~{}}15-16, followed by a brief period of $\Delta$z{\~{}}1, during which the intergalactic medium stays completely ionized because of sustained ionizing photon emission from concomitant Population III galaxies. The transition from Population III stars to Population II stars at z{\~{}}13 suddenly reduces, by a factor of {\~{}}10, the ionizing photon emission rate, causing hydrogen to rapidly recombine, marking the second cosmological recombination. From z{\~{}}13 to 6, Compton cooling by the cosmic microwave background and photoheating by the stars self-regulate the Jeans mass and the star formation rate, giving rise to a mean temperature of the intergalactic medium maintained nearly at a constant of {\~{}}104 K. Meanwhile, recombination and photoionization balance one another such that the intergalactic medium stays largely ionized during this stage, with nHII/nH{\textgreater}=0.6. Most of the star formation in this period occurs in large halos with dominant atomic line cooling. We discuss a wide range of implications and possible tests for this new reionization picture. In particular, the Thomson scattering optical depth is increased to 0.10+/-0.03, compared to 0.027 for the case of only one rapid reionization at z=6. Upcoming Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe observations of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background should be able to distinguish between these two scenarios. In addition, properties of minihalos at high redshift (z{\textgreater}=6) will be very different from previous expectations; in particular, they will be largely deprived of gas, perhaps alleviating the cosmological overcooling problem.},

We use a very high resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulation that achieves a dynamic range of {\~{}}1010 in length scale. With accurate treatment of atomic and molecular physics, including the effect of molecular line opacities and cooling by collision-induced continuum emission, it allows us to study the chemothermal evolution of primordial gas clouds to densities up to $\rho${\~{}}2×10-8 g cm-3 (nH{\~{}}1016 cm-3) without assuming any a priori equation of state, an improvement of 6 orders of magnitude over previous three-dimensional calculations. We study the evolution of a primordial star-forming gas cloud in the cosmological simulation in detail. The cloud core becomes marginally unstable against chemothermal instability when the gas cooling rate is increased owing to three-body molecule formation. However, since the core is already compact at that point, runaway cooling simply leads to fast condensation to form a single protostellar seed. During the final dynamical collapse, small angular momentum material collapses faster than the rest of the gas and selectively sinks inward. Consequently, the central regions have little specific angular momentum, and rotation does not halt collapse. We, for the first time, obtain an accurate gas mass accretion rate within a 10 Msolar innermost region around the protostar. We carry out protostellar evolution calculations using the obtained accretion rate. The resulting mass of the first star when it reaches the zero-age main sequence is MZAMS{\~{}}100 Msolar, and less ({\textgreater}{\~{}}60 Msolar) for substantially reduced accretion rates.},

abstract = {The weak, R-type ionization fronts (I-fronts) which swept across the intergalactic medium during the reionization of the Universe often found their paths blocked by cosmological minihaloes (haloes with virial temperatures Tvir{\textless}= 104 K). When this happened, the neutral gas which filled each minihalo was photoevaporated. In a cold dark matter universe, minihaloes formed in abundance before and during reionization and, thus, their photoevaporation is an important, possibly dominant, feature of reionization, which slowed it down and cost it many ionizing photons. In a previous paper, we described this process and presented our results of the first simulations of it by numerical gas dynamics with radiation transport in detail. In view of the importance of minihalo photoevaporation, both as a feedback mechanism on the minihaloes and as an effect on cosmic reionization, we have now performed a larger set of high-resolution simulations to determine and quantify the dependence of minihalo photoevaporation times and photon consumption rates on halo mass, redshift, ionizing flux level and spectrum. We use these results to derive simple expressions for the dependence of the evaporation time and photon consumption rate on these halo and external flux parameters. These can be conveniently applied to estimate the effects of minihaloes on the global reionization process in both semi-analytical calculations and larger-scale, lower-resolution numerical simulations, which cannot adequately resolve the minihaloes and their photoevaporation. We find that the average number of ionizing photons each minihalo atom absorbs during its photoevaporation is typically in the range 2-10. For the collapsed fraction in minihaloes expected during reionization, this can add about one photon per total atom to the requirements for completing reionization, potentially doubling the minimum number of photons required to reionize the Universe.},

abstract = {We investigate the formation of the first stars at the end of the cosmic dark ages with a suite of three-dimensional, moving mesh simulations that directly resolve the collapse of the gas beyond the formation of the first protostar at the centre of a dark matter minihalo. The simulations cover more than 25 orders of magnitude in density and have a maximum spatial resolution of 100 km, which extends well below the radius of individual protostars and captures their interaction with the surrounding gas. In analogy to previous studies that employed sink particles, we find that the Keplerian disc around the primary protostar fragments into a number of secondary protostars, which is enabled by H2 collisional dissociation cooling and collision-induced emission. The further evolution of the protostellar system is characterised by strong gravitational torques that transfer angular momentum between the secondary protostars formed in the disc and the surrounding gas. This leads to the migration of about half of the secondary protostars to the centre of the cloud in a free-fall time, where they merge with the primary protostar and facilitate its growth to about five times the mass of the second most massive protostar. By the same token, a fraction of the protostars obtain angular momentum from other protostars via N-body interactions and migrate to higher orbits. On average, only every third protostar survives until the end of the simulation. However, the number of protostars present at any given time increases monotonically, suggesting that the system will continue to grow beyond the limited period of time simulated here.},

The Pop III GRBs could be super-energetic with the isotropic energy up to Eiso ≳ 1055-57 erg, providing a unique probe of the high-redshift Universe. Methods: We consider both the so-called Pop III.1 stars (primordial) and Pop III.2 stars (primordial but affected by radiation from other stars). We employ a semi-analytical approach that considers inhomogeneous hydrogen reionization and chemical evolution of the intergalactic medium. Results: We show that Pop III.2 GRBs occur more than 100 times more frequently than Pop III.1 GRBs, and thus should be suitable targets for future GRB missions. Interestingly, our optimistic model predicts an event rate that is already constrained by the current radio transient searches. We expect {\~{}}10-104 radio afterglows above {\~{}}0.3 mJy on the sky with {\~{}}1 year variability and mostly without GRBs (orphans), which are detectable by ALMA, EVLA, LOFAR, and SKA, while we expect to observe maximum of N {\textless} 20 GRBs per year integrated over at z {\textgreater} 6 for Pop III.2 and N {\textless} 0.08 per year integrated over at z {\textgreater} 10 for Pop III.1 with EXIST, and N {\textless} 0.2 for Pop III.2 GRBs per year integrated over at z {\textgreater} 6 with Swift.},

abstract = {We present two new Lagrangian methods for hydrodynamics, in a systematic comparison with moving-mesh, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), and stationary (non-moving) grid methods. The new methods are designed to simultaneously capture advantages of both SPH and grid-based/adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) schemes. They are based on a kernel discretization of the volume coupled to a high-order matrix gradient estimator and a Riemann solver acting over the volume `overlap'. We implement and test a parallel, second-order version of the method with self-gravity and cosmological integration, in the code GIZMO:1 this maintains exact mass, energy and momentum conservation; exhibits superior angular momentum conservation compared to all other methods we study; does not require `artificial diffusion' terms; and allows the fluid elements to move with the flow, so resolution is automatically adaptive. We consider a large suite of test problems, and find that on all problems the new methods appear competitive with moving-mesh schemes, with some advantages (particularly in angular momentum conservation), at the cost of enhanced noise. The new methods have many advantages versus SPH: proper convergence, good capturing of fluid-mixing instabilities, dramatically reduced `particle noise' and numerical viscosity, more accurate sub-sonic flow evolution, and sharp shock-capturing. Advantages versus non-moving meshes include: automatic adaptivity, dramatically reduced advection errors and numerical overmixing, velocity-independent errors, accurate coupling to gravity, good angular momentum conservation and elimination of `grid alignment' effects. We can, for example, follow hundreds of orbits of gaseous discs, while AMR and SPH methods break down in a few orbits. However, fixed meshes minimize `grid noise'. These differences are important for a range of astrophysical problems.},

abstract = {Understanding the formation of the first stars is one of the frontier topics in modern astrophysics and cosmology. Their emergence signalled the end of the cosmic dark ages, a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, leading to a fundamental transformation of the early Universe through the production of ionizing photons and the initial enrichment with heavy chemical elements. We here review the state of our knowledge, separating the well understood elements of our emerging picture from those where more work is required. Primordial star formation is unique in that its initial conditions can be directly inferred from the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model of cosmological structure formation. Combined with gas cooling that is mediated via molecular hydrogen, one can robustly identify the regions of primordial star formation, the so-called minihalos, having total masses of {\~{}}10(6) M⊙ and collapsing at redshifts z ≈ 20-30. Within this framework, a number of studies have defined a preliminary standard model, with the main result that the first stars were predominantly massive. This model has recently been modified to include a ubiquitous mode of fragmentation in the protostellar disks, such that the typical outcome of primordial star formation may be the formation of a binary or small multiple stellar system. We will also discuss extensions to this standard picture due to the presence of dynamically significant magnetic fields, of heating from self-annihalating WIMP dark matter, or cosmic rays. We conclude by discussing possible strategies to empirically test our theoretical models. Foremost among them are predictions for the upcoming James Webb space telescope (JWST), to be launched {\~{}}2018, and for 'stellar archaeology', which probes the abundance pattern in the oldest, most-metal poor stars in our cosmic neighborhood, thereby constraining the nucleosynthesis inside the first supernovae.},

Excess over the point-spread function in the surface brightness profile is statistically significant at 3.5$\sigma$ (99.95{\%} confidence level), for the nearby, hard population of AGNs. The halo size and brightness are consistent with IGMF, B IGMF ≈ 10-15 G. The knowledge of IGMF will facilitate the future gamma-ray and charged-particle astronomy. Furthermore, since IGMFs are likely to originate from the primordial seed fields created shortly after the big bang, this potentially opens a new window on the origin of cosmological magnetic fields, inflation, and the phase transitions in the early universe.},

The simulations use an Eulerian adaptive mesh refinement technique with initial conditions drawn from a flat $\Lambda$-dominated cold dark matter model cosmology to follow the non-equilibrium chemistry of nine chemical species in the presence of both a soft ultraviolet Lyman-Werner H2 photodissociating flux of strength FLW= 10-21 erg s-1 cm-2 Hz-1 and soft X-ray background extending to 7.2 keV, including the ionization and heating effects caused by secondary electrons. Although we vary the normalization of the X-ray background by two orders of magnitude, the positive feedback effect of the X-rays on cooling and collapse of the pre-galactic cloud expected owing to the increased electron fraction is quite mild, only weakly affecting the mass threshold for collapse and the fraction of gas within the cloud that is able to cool, condense and become available for star formation. Inside most of the cloud we find that H2 is in photodissociation equilibrium with the soft ultraviolet (UV) flux. The net buildup of the electron density needed to enhance H2 formation occurs too slowly compared with the H2 photodissociation and dynamical time-scales within the cloud to overcome the negative impact of the soft UV photodissociating flux on cloud collapse. However, we find that even in the most extreme cases the first objects to form do rely on molecular hydrogen as a coolant and we stress that our results do not justify the neglect of these objects in models of galaxy formation. Outside the cloud we find the dominant effect of a sufficiently strong X-ray background is to heat and partially ionize the intergalactic medium, in qualitative agreement with previous studies.},

abstract = {A method for following fragmentation simulations further in time using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is presented. In a normal SPH simulation of the collapse and fragmentation of a molecular cloud, high-density regions of gas that form protostars are represented by many particles with small separations. These high-density regions require small time-steps, limiting the time for which the simulation can be followed. Thus, the end result of the fragmentation can never be definitively ascertained, and comparisons between cloud fragmentation calculations and the observed characteristics of stellar systems cannot be made. In this paper, each high-density region is replaced by a single, non-gaseous particle, with appropriate boundary conditions, which contains all the mass in the region and accretes any infalling mass. This enables the evolution of the cloud and the resulting protostars to be followed for many orbits or until most of the original cloud mass has been accreted. The Boss {\&} Bodenheimer standard isothermal test case for the fragmentation of an interstellar cloud is used as an example for the technique. It is found that the binary protostellar system that forms initially does not merge, but instead forms a multiple system. The collapse is followed to four initial cloud free-fall times when approximately 80 per cent of the original mass of the cloud has been accreted by the protostars, or surrounds them in discs, and the remainder of the material has been expelled out to the radius of the initial cloud by the binary.},

abstract = {We use one-dimensional radiative transfer simulations to study the evolution of H2 gas-phase (H- catalyzed) formation and photodissociation regions in the primordial universe. We find a new positive feedback mechanism capable of producing shells of H2 in the intergalactic medium (IGM), which are optically thick in some Lyman-Werner bands. While these shells exist, this feedback effect is important in reducing the H2 dissociating background flux and the size of photodissociation spheres around each luminous object. The maximum background opacity of the IGM in the H2 Lyman-Werner bands is $\tau$H2{\~{}}1-2 for a relic molecular fraction xH2=2×10-6, about 6 times greater than that found by Haiman, Abel, {\&} Rees. Therefore, the relic molecular hydrogen can decrease the photodissociation rate by about an order of magnitude. The problem is relevant to the formation of small primordial galaxies with masses MDM{\textless}{\~{}}108 Msolar that rely on molecular hydrogen cooling to collapse. Alternatively, the universe may have remained dark for several hundred million years after the birth of the first stars, until galaxies with virial temperature Tvir{\textgreater}{\~{}}104 K formed.},

@article{Vasiliev2008,
abstract = {Context: This paper is motivated by the recent detection of many extremely metal-deficient ([{\{}Fe/H{\}}]{\textless}-3) stars in the Milky Way. Aims: We numerically explore the chemical, thermal, and dynamical evolution of a shell formed by a high-energy supernova explosion (1053 erg) in dwarf protogalaxies with a total (dark matter plus baryonic) mass 10{\^{}}7 M{\_}ȯ at a redshift z=12. We consider two initial configurations for the baryonic matter, one without rotation and the other having the ratio of rotational to gravitational energy $\beta$=0.17. The (non-rotating) dark matter halo is described by a quasi-isothermal sphere. This choice is motivated by recently proposed mechanisms for rapid flattening of a central cuspy region in dwarf protogalaxies. Methods: We use a finite-difference numerical hydrodynamics code to simulate supernova explosions in dwarf protogalaxies with axial symmetry. The advection is treated using a third-order piecewise parabolic scheme. The heating and cooling processes in the gas are taken into account by solving the rate equations numerically for the main atomic, molecular, and ionic species in the primordial gas. Results: We find that the dynamics of the shell is different in protogalaxies with and those without rotation. For instance, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in the shell develops faster in protogalaxies without rotation. The fraction of a blown-away baryonic mass is approximately twice as high in models with rotation than in models without rotation. We argue that these differences are caused by different initial gas density profiles in non-rotating and rotating protogalaxies. On the other hand, the chemical evolution of gas in protogalaxies with and without rotation is found to be similar. The relative number densities of molecular hydrogen and HD molecules in the cold gas (T ≤ 103 K) saturate at typical values of 10-3 and 10-7, respectively. The saturation times in models with rotation are somewhat longer than in models without rotation. The clumps formed in the fragmented shell move with velocities that are at least twice as high as the escape velocity. The mass of the clumps is 0.1-10 M{\_}ȯ, which is lower than the Jeans mass. We conclude that the clumps are pressure supported. Conclusions: A supernova explosion with energy 1053 erg destroys our model protogalaxy. The clumps formed in the fragmented shell are pressure supported. We conclude that protogalaxies with a total mass ˜107 M{\_}ȯ are unlikely to form stars due to high-energy supernova explosions of the first stars.},

abstract = {Ionizing UV radiation and supernova (SN) flows amidst clustered minihalos at high redshift regulated the rise of the first stellar populations in the universe. Previous studies have addressed the effects of very massive primordial stars on the collapse of nearby halos into new stars, but the absence of the odd-even nucleosynthetic signature of pair-instability SNe in ancient metal-poor stars suggests that Population III stars may have been less than 100 M sun. We extend our earlier survey of local UV feedback on star formation to 25-80 M sun stars and include kinetic feedback by SNe for 25-40 M sun stars. We find radiative feedback to be relatively uniform over this mass range, primarily because the larger fluxes of more massive stars are offset by their shorter lifetimes. Our models demonstrate that prior to the rise of global UV backgrounds, Lyman-Werner (LW) photons from nearby stars cannot prevent halos from forming new stars. These calculations also reveal that violent dynamical instabilities can erupt in the UV radiation front enveloping a primordial halo, but that they ultimately have no effect on the formation of a star. Finally, our simulations suggest that relic H II regions surrounding partially evaporated halos may expel LW backgrounds at lower redshifts, allowing stars to form that were previously suppressed. We provide fits to radiative and kinetic feedback on star formation for use in both semianalytic models and numerical simulations.},

@article{Glassgold2004,
abstract = {We calculate the thermal-chemical structure of the gaseous atmospheres of the inner disks of T Tauri stars, starting from the density and dust temperature distributions derived by D'Alessio and coworkers in 1999. As a result of processes such as X-ray irradiation or mechanical heating of the surface layers, the gas temperature at the very top of the disk atmosphere in the neighborhood of 1 AU is of the order of 5000 K. Deep down, it drops rapidly into the range of the dust temperature, i.e., several hundred degrees kelvin. In between these upper hot and lower cool layers, there is a transition zone with gas temperatures in the range 500-2000 K. The thickness and location of this warm region depend on the strength of the surface heating. This region also manifests the basic chemical transitions of H to H2 and C+ and C to CO. It is remarkable that even though the H2 transition begins first (higher up), it does not go to completion until after CO does. Consequently, there is a reasonably thick layer of warm CO that is predominantly atomic H. This thermal-chemical structure is favorable to the excitation of the fundamental and overtone bands of CO because of the large rate coefficients for vibrational excitation in H+CO as opposed to H2+CO collisions. This conclusion is supported by the recent observations of the fundamental band transitions in most T Tauri stars. We also argue that layered atmospheres of inner T Tauri disks may play an important role in understanding the observations of H2 UV fluorescence pumped from excited vibrational levels of that molecule. Possible candidates for surface heating include the interaction of a wind with the upper layers of the disk and dissipation of hydromagnetic waves generated by mechanical disturbances close to the midplane, e.g., by the Balbus-Hawley instability. Detailed modeling of the observations has the potential to reveal the nature of the mechanical surface heating that we model phenomenologically in these calculations and to help explain the nature of the gas in protoplanetary disks.},

abstract = {We explore possibilities of collapse and star formation in Population III objects exposed to the external ultraviolet background (UVB) radiation. Assuming spherical symmetry, we solve self-consistently radiative transfer of photons, non-equilibrium H2 chemistry and gas hydrodynamics. Although the UVB does suppress the formation of low-mass objects, the negative feedback turns out to be weaker than previously suggested. In particular, the cut-off scale of collapse drops significantly below the virial temperature Tvir{\~{}}104K at weak UV intensities (J21{\textless}{\~{}}10-2), owing to both self-shielding of the gas and H2 cooling. Clouds above this cut-off tend to contract highly dynamically, further promoting self-shielding and H2 formation. For plausible radiation intensities and spectra, the collapsing gas can cool efficiently to temperatures well below 104K before rotationally supported and the final H2 fraction reaches {\~{}}10-3. Our results imply that star formation can take place in low-mass objects collapsing in the UVB. The threshold baryon mass for star formation is {\~{}}109Msolar for clouds collapsing at redshifts z{\textless}{\~{}}3, but drops significantly at higher redshifts. In a conventional cold dark matter universe, the latter coincides roughly with that of the 1$\sigma$ density fluctuations. Objects near and above this threshold can thus constitute `building blocks' of luminous structures, and we discuss their links to dwarf spheroidal/elliptical galaxies and faint blue objects. These results suggest that the UVB can play a key role in regulating the star formation history of the Universe.},

abstract = {The first stars in the universe ionized the ambient primordial gas through various feedback processes. "Second-generation" primordial stars potentially form from this disturbed gas after its recombination. In this Letter, we study the late formation stage of such second-generation stars, where a large amount of gas accretes onto the protostar and the final stellar mass is determined when the accretion terminates. We directly compute the complex interplay between the accretion flow and stellar ultraviolet (UV) radiation, performing radiation-hydrodynamic simulations coupled with stellar evolution calculations. Because of more efficient H2 and HD cooling in the pre-stellar stage, the accretion rates onto the star are 10 times lower than in the case of the formation of the first stars. The lower accretion rates and envelope density result in the occurrence of an expanding bipolar H II region at a lower protostellar mass M * {\~{}}= 10 M ⊙, which blows out the circumstellar material, thereby quenching the mass supply from the envelope to the accretion disk. At the same time the disk loses mass due to photoevaporation by the growing star. In our fiducial case the stellar UV feedback terminates mass accretion onto the star at M * {\~{}}= 17 M ⊙. Although the derived masses of the second-generation primordial stars are systematically lower than those of the first generation, the difference is within a factor of only a few. Our results suggest a new scenario, whereby the majority of the primordial stars are born as massive stars with tens of solar masses, regardless of their generations.},

Combining Planck with other astrophysical data we find N{\_} eff = 3.15 +/- 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and the sum of neutrino masses is constrained to {\textless} 0.23 eV. Spatial curvature is found to be |Omega{\_}K| {\textless} 0.005. For LCDM we find a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r {\textless}0.11 consistent with the B-mode constraints from an analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP data leads to a tighter constraint of r {\textless} 0.09. We find no evidence for isocurvature perturbations or cosmic defects. The equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 +/- 0.045. Standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the Planck LCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We investigate annihilating dark matter and deviations from standard recombination, finding no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base LCDM are in agreement with BAO data and with the JLA SNe sample. However the amplitude of the fluctuations is found to be higher than inferred from rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. Apart from these tensions, the base LCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

We follow the evolution of the primordial gas up to densities of 1012 cm-3. Representing the growing hydrostatic cores with accreting sink particles, we measure the velocities and angular momenta of all particles that fall on to these protostellar regions. This allows us to record the angular momentum of the sinks and estimate the rotational velocity of the Pop III stars expected to form within them. The rotation rate has important implications for the evolution of the star, the fate encountered at the end of its life, and the potential for triggering a gamma-ray burst (GRB). We find that there is sufficient angular momentum to yield rapidly rotating stars (≳1000 km s-1, or near break-up speeds). This indicates that Pop III stars likely experienced strong rotational mixing, impacting their structure and nucleosynthetic yields. A subset of them was also likely to result in hypernova explosions and possibly GRBs.},

XBs observationally appear able to deposit a high fraction of their power output into their local interstellar medium, which may make them a non-negligible source of energy input. The formation rate of the most luminous XBs rises with decreasing metallicity, which should increase their significance during galaxy formation in the early Universe. We also argue that stochastic effects are important to XB feedback (XBF) and may dominate the systematic changes due to metallicity in many cases. Large stochastic variation in the magnitude of XBF at low absolute star formation rates provides a natural reason for diversity in the evolution of dwarf galaxies which were initially almost identical, with several per cent of such haloes experiencing energy input from XBs roughly two orders of magnitude above the most likely value. These probability distributions suggest that the effect of XBF is most commonly significant for total stellar masses between approximately 107 and 108 Msun, which might resolve a current problem with modelling populations of such galaxies. We explain how XBs might inject energy before luminous supernovae (SNe) contribute significantly to feedback and how XBs can assist in keeping gas hot long after the last core-collapse SN has exploded. Energy input from XBs produces different behaviour to that from SNe, partly since the peak energy input from a mean XB population continues for ≈100 Myr after the start of a starburst. XBF could be especially important to some dwarf galaxies, potentially heating gas without expelling it; the properties of XBF also match those previously derived as allowing episodic star formation. We also argue that the efficiency of SN feedback (SNF) might be reduced when XBF has had the opportunity to act first. In addition, we note that the effect of SNF is unlikely to be scale-free; galaxies smaller than ≈100 pc might well experience less effective SNF.},

abstract = {The advent of large cosmological sky surveys—ushering in the era of precision cosmology—has been accompanied by ever larger cosmological simulations. The analysis of these simulations, which currently encompass tens of billions of particles and up to a trillion particles in the near future, is often as daunting as carrying out the simulations in the first place. Therefore, the development of very efficient analysis tools combining qualitative and quantitative capabilities is a matter of some urgency. In this paper, we introduce new analysis features implemented within ParaView, a fully parallel, open-source visualization toolkit, to analyze large N-body simulations. A major aspect of ParaView is that it can live and operate on the same machines and utilize the same parallel power as the simulation codes themselves. In addition, data movement is in a serious bottleneck now and will become even more of an issue in the future; an interactive visualization and analysis tool that can handle data in situ is fast becoming essential. The new features in ParaView include particle readers and a very efficient halo finder that identifies friends-of-friends halos and determines common halo properties, including spherical overdensity properties. In combination with many other functionalities already existing within ParaView, such as histogram routines or interfaces to programming languages like Python, this enhanced version enables fast, interactive, and convenient analyses of large cosmological simulations. In addition, development paths are available for future extensions.},

The obtained minihalos are used as the initial conditions of local three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations to investigate the formation of the first stars. We find that two-thirds of the minihalos host multiple stars, while the other third has single stars. The mass of the stars found in our simulations are in the range of 1 M ⊙ {\textless}{\~{}} M {\textless}{\~{}} 300 M ⊙, peaking at several× 10 M ⊙. Most of the very massive stars of {\textgreater}{\~{}} 140 M ⊙ are born as single stars, although not all of the single stars are very massive. We also find a few stars of {\textless}{\~{}} 1 M ⊙ that are kicked by the gravitational three body interactions to the position distant from the center of mass. The frequency that a star forming minihalo contains a binary system is {\~{}}50{\%}. We also investigate the abundance pattern of the stellar remnants by summing up the contributions from the first stars in the simulations. Consequently, the pattern is compatible with that of the low metallicity damped Ly$\alpha$ systems or the extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars, if the mass spectrum obtained in our experiment is shifted to the low mass side by 0.2 dex. If we consider the case that an EMP star is born in the remnant of the individual minihalo without mixing with others, the chemical signature of the pair instability supernova is more prominent, because most of them are born as single stars.},

These objects are likely single, very massive stars that are copious UV emitters. We present analytical estimates as well as one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic calculations of the evolution of these first H II regions in the universe. The initially D-type ionization front (I-front) evolves to become R-type within {\textless}{\~{}}105 yr at a distance of {\~{}}1 pc. This ionization front then completely overruns the halo, accelerating an expanding shell of gas outward to velocities in excess of 30 km s-1, about 10 times the escape velocity of the confining dark matter halo. We find that the evolution of the H II region depends only weakly on the assumed stellar ionizing luminosities. Consequently, most of the gas surrounding the first stars will leave the dark halo whether or not the stars produce supernovae. If they form the first massive seed black holes, these are unlikely to accrete within a Hubble time after they formed until they are incorporated into larger dark matter halos that contain more gas. Because these I-fronts exit the halo on timescales much shorter than the stars' main-sequence lifetimes, their host halos have UV escape fractions of {\textgreater}{\~{}}0.95, fixing an important parameter for theoretical studies of cosmological hydrogen reionization.},

abstract = {The issue of which stars may reach the conditions of electron/positron pair formation instability is of importance to understand the final evolution both of the first stars and of contemporary stars. The criterion to enter the pair instability regime in density and temperature is basically controlled by the mass of the oxygen core. The main sequence masses that produce a given oxygen core mass are, in turn, dependent on metallicity, mass loss, and convective and rotationally-induced mixing. We examine the evolution of massive stars to determine the minimum main sequence mass that can encounter pair-instability effects, either a pulsational pair instability (PPISN) or a full-fledged pair-instability supernova (PISN). We concentrate on zero-metallicity stars with no mass loss subject to the Schwarzschild criterion for convective instability, but also explore solar metallicity and mass loss and the Ledoux criterion. As expected, for sufficiently strong rotationally-induced mixing, the minimum main sequence mass is encountered for conditions that induce effectively homogeneous evolution such that the original mass is converted almost entirely to helium and then to oxygen. For this case, we find that the minimum main sequence mass is about 40Msun to encounter PPISN and about 65Msun to encounter a PISN. The implications of these results for the first stars and for contemporary supernovae is discussed.},

abstract = {We investigate the impact of an ionising X-ray background on metal-free Population III stars within a minihalo at {\$}z\backslashsimeq25{\$} starting from cosmological initial conditions. Using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code GADGET-2, we attain sufficient numerical resolution to follow the gas collapsing into the centre of the minihalo up to densities of {\$}n=10{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}\backslash,cm{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}, at which point we form sink particles. This allows us to study how the presence of a cosmic X-ray background (CXB) affects the formation of H{\$}{\_}2{\$} and HD in the gas before it becomes fully molecular. Using a suite of simulations for a range of possible CXB models, we follow each simulation for 5000 yr after the formation of the first sink particle. The CXB provides two competing effects, with X-rays both heating the gas and enhancing its ability to cool by increasing the free electron fraction, allowing more H{\$}{\_}2{\$} to form. We find that X-ray heating dominates below {\$}n\backslashsim1\backslash,cm{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}, while the additional cooling catalysed by X-ray ionisation becomes more important above {\$}n\backslashsim10{\^{}}2\backslash,cm{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}. Heating the gas impedes its collapse, decreasing the total amount of gas available for star formation. However if the CXB is strong enough, the gas that does collapse cools sufficiently to activate HD cooling, leading to further cooling and fragmentation. If at the same time the CXB is also not so strong as to choke off the supply of gas collapsing into the halo, this additional cooling allows more of the available gas to collapse to high densities, counteracting the effects of X-ray heating at low densities and increasing both the total mass and number of sink particles dramatically. This leads to a `Goldilocks' range of CXB strengths for which fragmentation increases significantly, from 2-3 sink particles to 10; continuing to increase the CXB chokes off the gas supply and suppresses both sink formation and fragmentation.},

In a companion paper (Anninos et al., 1997)[NewA, 2, 209] numerical methods are presented that unify the modeling of non-equilibrium primordial gas chemistry and cooling dicussed here with cosmological hydrodynamics. We derived new fits of rate coefficients for the photo-attachment of neutral hydrogen, the formation of molecular hydrogen via H -, charge exchange beween H 2 and H +, electron detachment of H - by neutral hydrogen, dissociative recombination of H 2+ with slow electrons, photodissociation of H 2+, and photodissociation of H 2. Furthermore it was found that the molecular hydrogen produced through the gas-phase processes, H 2+ + H → H 2 + H +, and H - + H → H 2 + e -, is likely to be converted into its para configuration on a faster time scale than the formation time. We have tested the model extensively and shown it to agree well with former studies. We further studied the chemical kinetics in great detail and devised a minimal model which is substantially simpler than the full reaction network but predicts correct abundances. This minimal model shows convincingly that 12 collisional processes are sufficient to model the H, He, H +, H -, He +, He ++, and H 2 abundances in low density primordial gas for applications with no radiation fields.},

We investigate the conditions required in order for H2 to dominate, and show that it provides significant cooling only when the ratio of the interstellar radiation field strength to the gas density is small.

For this purpose, we perform three-dimensional RHD simulations in which the radiative transfer of ionizing photons and H2-dissociating photons from a first star is self-consistently coupled with hydrodynamics based on a smoothed particle hydrodynamics method. It is shown that density peaks above a threshold density can keep collapsing, owing to the shielding of H2-dissociating radiation by an H2 shell formed ahead of a D-type ionization front. But, below the threshold density an M-type ionization front with a shock propagates, and density peaks are radiation-hydrodynamically evaporated by the shock. The threshold density depends on the distance from the source star and is {\~{}}102 cm-3 for a source distance of 30 pc.

abstract = {We examine aspects of primordial star formation in the presence of a molecular hydrogen-dissociating ultraviolet background. We compare a set of AMR hydrodynamic cosmological simulations using a single cosmological realization, but with a range of ultraviolet background strengths in the Lyman-Werner band. This allows us to study the effects of Lyman-Werner radiation on suppressing H2 cooling at low densities, as well as the high-density evolution of the collapsing cloud core in a self-consistent cosmological framework. We find that the addition of a photodissociating background results in a delay of the collapse of high-density gas at the center of the most massive halo in the simulation and, as a result, an increase in the virial mass of this halo at the onset of baryon collapse. We find that, contrary to previous results, Population III star formation is not suppressed for J21{\textgreater}=0.1, but occurs even with backgrounds as high as J21=1. We find that H2 cooling leads to collapse despite the depressed core molecular hydrogen fractions due to the elevated H 2 cooling rates at T=2-5×103 K. We observe a relationship between the strength of the photodissociating background and the rate of accretion onto the evolving protostellar cloud core, with higher LW background fluxes resulting in higher accretion rates. Finally, we find that the collapsing cloud cores in our simulations do not fragment at densities below n{\~{}}1010 cm-3, regardless of the strength of the LW background, suggesting that Population III stars forming in halos with Tvir{\~{}}104 K may still form in isolation.},

abstract = {(Abridged) We study the rate at which gas accretes on to galaxies and haloes and investigate whether the accreted gas was shocked to high temperatures before reaching a galaxy. For this purpose we use a suite of large cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations from the OWLS project. We improve on previous work by considering a wider range of halo masses and redshifts, by distinguishing accretion on to haloes and galaxies, by including important feedback processes, and by comparing simulations with different physics. The specific rate of gas accretion on to haloes is, like that for dark matter, only weakly dependent on halo mass. For halo masses Mhalo{\textgreater}{\textgreater}10{\^{}}11 Msun it is relatively insensitive to feedback processes. In contrast, accretion rates on to galaxies are determined by radiative cooling and by outflows driven by supernovae and active galactic nuclei. Galactic winds increase the halo mass at which the central galaxies grow the fastest by about two orders of magnitude to Mhalo{\~{}}10{\^{}}12 Msun. Gas accretion is bimodal, with maximum past temperatures either of order the virial temperature or {\textless}{\~{}}10{\^{}}5 K. The fraction of gas accreted on to haloes in the hot mode is insensitive to feedback and metal-line cooling. It increases with redshift, but is mostly determined by halo mass, increasing gradually from less than 10{\%} for {\~{}}10{\^{}}11 Msun to greater than 90{\%} at 10{\^{}}13 Msun. In contrast, for accretion on to galaxies the cold mode is always significant and the relative contributions of the two accretion modes are more sensitive to feedback and metal-line cooling. On average, the majority of stars present in any mass halo at any redshift were formed from gas accreted in the cold mode, although the hot mode contributes typically over 10{\%} for Mhalo{\textgreater}{\~{}}10{\^{}}11 Msun. Galaxies, but not their gaseous haloes, are predominantly fed by gas that did not experience an accretion shock when it entered the host halo.},

SFR functions provide a more physical description of galaxy buildup at high redshift and allow for direct comparisons to SFRs at lower redshifts determined by a variety of techniques. Our SFR functions are derived from well-established z {\~{}} 4-7 UV LFs, UV-continuum slope trends with redshift and luminosity, and infrared excess (IRX)-$\beta$ relations. They are well described by Schechter relations. We extend the comparison baseline for SFR functions to z {\~{}} 2 by considering recent determinations of the H$\alpha$ and mid-IR LFs. The low-end slopes of the SFR functions are flatter than for the UV LFs, $\Delta$$\alpha$ {\~{}} +0.13, and show no clear evolution with cosmic time (z {\~{}} 0-7). In addition, we find that the characteristic value SFR* from the Schechter fit to the SFR function exhibits consistent, and substantial, linear growth as a function of redshift from {\~{}}5 M sun yr-1 at z {\~{}} 8, 650 Myr after the big bang, to {\~{}}100 M sun yr-1 at z {\~{}} 2, {\~{}}2.5 Gyr later. Recent results at z {\~{}} 10, close to the onset of galaxy formation, are consistent with this trend. The uniformity of this evolution is even greater than seen in the UV LF over the redshift range z {\~{}} 2-8, providing validation for our dust corrections. These results provide strong evidence that galaxies build up uniformly over the first 3 Gyr of cosmic time.},

abstract = {The element abundance ratios of four low-mass stars with extremely low metallicities indicate that the gas out of which the stars formed was enriched in each case by at most a few, and potentially only one low-energy, supernova. Such supernovae yield large quantities of light elements such as carbon but very little iron. The dominance of low-energy supernovae is surprising, because it has been expected that the first stars were extremely massive, and that they disintegrated in pair-instability explosions that would rapidly enrich galaxies in iron. What has remained unclear is the yield of iron from the first supernovae, because hitherto no star is unambiguously interpreted as encapsulating the yield of a single supernova. Here we report the optical spectrum of SMSS J031300.36- 670839.3, which shows no evidence of iron (with an upper limit of 10{\^{}}-7.1 times solar abundance). Based on a comparison of its abundance pattern with those of models, we conclude that the star was seeded with material from a single supernova with an original mass of {\~{}}60 Mo (and that the supernova left behind a black hole). Taken together with the previously mentioned low-metallicity stars, we conclude that low-energy supernovae were common in the early Universe, and that such supernovae yield light element enrichment with insignificant iron. Reduced stellar feedback both chemically and mechanically from low-energy supernovae would have enabled first-generation stars to form over an extended period. We speculate that such stars may perhaps have had an important role in the epoch of cosmic reionization and the chemical evolution of early galaxies.},

abstract = {Wind models of very massive stars with metallicities in a range from 10-4 to 1.0 solar are calculated using a new treatment of radiation-driven winds with depth-dependent radiative force multipliers and a comprehensive list of more than two million spectral lines in non-LTE (NLTE). The models are tested by a comparison with observed stellar wind properties of O stars in the Galaxy and the SMC. Satisfying agreement is found. The calculations yield mass-loss rates, wind velocities, wind momenta, and wind energies as functions of metallicity and can be used to discuss the influence of stellar winds on the evolution of very massive stars in the early universe and on the interstellar medium in the early phases of galaxy formation. It is shown that the normal scaling laws, which predict stellar mass-loss rates and wind momenta to decrease as a power law with metal abundance, break down at a certain threshold. Analytical fit formulae for mass-loss rates are provided as a function of stellar parameters and metallicity. Ionizing fluxes of hot stars depend crucially on the strengths of their stellar winds, which modify the absorption edges of hydrogen and helium (neutral and ionized) and the line blocking in the far-UV. The new wind models are therefore also applied to calculate ionizing fluxes and observable spectra of very massive stars as a function of metallicity using the new hydrodynamic, NLTE line-blanketed flux constant model atmosphere code developed by Pauldrach and coworkers. Numbers of ionizing photons for the crucial ionization stages are given. For a fixed effective temperature, the He II ionizing emergent flux depends very strongly on metallicity but also on stellar luminosity. A strong dependence on metallicity is also found for the C III, Ne II, and O II ionizing photons, whereas the H I and He I ionizing flux is almost independent of metallicity. We also calculate UV spectra for all the models and discuss the behavior of significant line features as a function of metallicity.},

abstract = {We describe results from a fully self-consistent three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation of the formation of one of the first stars in the Universe. In current models of structure formation, dark matter initially dominates, and pregalactic objects form because of gravitational instability from small initial density perturbations. As they assemble via hierarchical merging, primordial gas cools through ro-vibrational lines of hydrogen molecules and sinks to the center of the dark matter potential well. The high-redshift analog of a molecular cloud is formed. As the dense, central parts of the cold gas cloud become self-gravitating, a dense core of approximately 100 M (where M is the mass of the Sun) undergoes rapid contraction. At particle number densities greater than 10(9) per cubic centimeter, a 1 M protostellar core becomes fully molecular as a result of three-body H2 formation. Contrary to analytical expectations, this process does not lead to renewed fragmentation and only one star is formed. The calculation is stopped when optical depth effects become important, leaving the final mass of the fully formed star somewhat uncertain. At this stage the protostar is accreting material very rapidly (approximately 10(-2) M year-1). Radiative feedback from the star will not only halt its growth but also inhibit the formation of other stars in the same pregalactic object (at least until the first star ends its life, presumably as a supernova). We conclude that at most one massive (M 1 M) metal-free star forms per pregalactic halo, consistent with recent abundance measurements of metal-poor galactic halo stars.},

abstract = {We develop a simple analytic model for the gravitational clustering of dark matter haloes to understand how their spatial distribution is biased relative to that of the mass. The statistical distribution of dark haloes within the initial density field (assumed Gaussian) is determined by an extension of the Press-Schechter formalism. Modifications of this distribution caused by gravitationally induced motions are treated using a spherical collapse approximation. We test this model against results from a variety of N-body simulations, and find that it gives an accurate description of a bias function, b(M, R, delta)=delta{\_}h(M, R, delta)/delta, where delta{\_}h(M, R, delta) is the mean overdensity of haloes of mass M within spheres which have radius R and mass overdensity delta the results depend only very weakly on how haloes are identified in the simulations. This bias function is sufficient to calculate the cross-correlation between dark haloes and mass, and again we find excellent agreement between simulation results and analytic predictions. Because haloes are spatially exclusive, the variance in the count of objects within spheres of fixed radius and overdensity is significantly smaller than the Poisson value. This seriously complicates any analytic calculation of the autocorrelation function of dark haloes. Our simulation results show, however, that this autocorrelation function is proportional to that of the mass over a wide range in R, even including scales where both functions are significantly greater than unity. Furthermore, the constant of proportionality is very close to that predicted on large scales by the analytic model. Since analytic formulae for the non-linear autocorrelation function of the mass are already known, this result permits an entirely analytic estimate of the autocorrelation function of dark haloes. We use our model to study how the distribution of galaxies may be biased with respect to that of the mass. In conjunction with other data these techniques should make it possible to measure the amplitude of cosmic mass fluctuations and the density of the Universe.},

abstract = {We investigate the properties of the first galaxies at z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 10 with highly resolved numerical simulations, starting from cosmological initial conditions and taking into account all relevant primordial chemistry and cooling. A first galaxy is characterized by the onset of atomic hydrogen cooling, once the virial temperature exceeds {\~{}}=104K, and its ability to retain photoheated gas. We follow the complex accretion and star formation history of a {\~{}}=5 × 107Msolar system by means of a detailed merger tree and derive an upper limit on the number of Population III (Pop III) stars formed prior to its assembly. We investigate the thermal and chemical evolution of infalling gas and find that partial ionization at temperatures {\textgreater}{\~{}}104K catalyses the formation of H2 and hydrogen deuteride, allowing the gas to cool to the temperature of the cosmic microwave background. Depending on the strength of radiative and chemical feedback, primordial star formation might be dominated by intermediate-mass Pop III stars formed during the assembly of the first galaxies. Accretion on to the nascent galaxy begins with hot accretion, where gas is accreted directly from the intergalactic medium and shock heated to the virial temperature, but is quickly accompanied by a phase of cold accretion, where the gas cools in filaments before flowing into the parent halo with high velocities. The latter drives supersonic turbulence at the centre of the galaxy and could lead to very efficient chemical mixing. The onset of turbulence in the first galaxies thus likely marks the transition to Pop II star formation.},

abstract = {There has been considerable theoretical debate over whether photoionization and supernova feedback from the first Population III stars facilitate or suppress the formation of the next generation of stars. We present results from an Eulerian adaptive mesh refinement simulation demonstrating the formation of a primordial star within a region ionized by an earlier nearby star. Despite the higher temperatures of the ionized gas and its flow out of the dark matter potential wells, this second star formed within 23 million years of its neighbor's death. The enhanced electron fraction within the H II region catalyzes rapid molecular hydrogen formation that leads to faster cooling in the subsequent star-forming halos than in the first halos. This ``second generation'' primordial protostar has a much lower accretion rate because, unlike the first protostar, it forms in a rotationally supported disk of {\~{}}10-100 Msolar. This is primarily due to the much higher angular momentum of the halo in which the second star forms. In contrast to previously published scenarios, such configurations may allow binaries or multiple systems of lower mass stars to form. These first high-resolution calculations offer insight into the impact of feedback upon subsequent populations of stars and clearly demonstrate how primordial chemistry promotes the formation of subsequent generations of stars even in the presence of the entropy injected by the first stars into the intergalactic medium.},

abstract = {We use three-dimensional cosmological simulations with radiative transfer to study the formation and evolution of the first galaxies in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The simulations include continuum radiative transfer using the optically thin variable Eddington tensor (OTVET) approximation and line radiative transfer in the H2 Lyman-Werner bands of the UV background radiation. Chemical and thermal processes are treated in detail, particularly the ones relevant for H2 formation and destruction. We find that the first luminous objects (``small-halo objects'') are characterized by bursting star formation (SF) that is self-regulated by a feedback process acting on cosmological instead of galactic scales. The global SF history is regulated by the mean number of ionizing photons that escape from each source, ɛUV{\textless}fesc{\textgreater}. It is almost independent of the assumed SF efficiency parameter, ɛ*, and the intensity of the dissociating background. The main feedback process that regulates the SF is the reformation of H2 in front of H II regions and inside relic H II regions. The H II regions remain confined inside filaments, maximizing the production of H2 in overdense regions through cyclic destruction/reformation of H2. If ɛUV{\textless}fesc{\textgreater}{\textgreater}10- 7/ɛ*, the SF is self-regulated, photoevaporation of small-halo objects dominates the metal pollution of the low-density intergalactic medium, and the mass of produced metals depends only on {\textless}fesc{\textgreater}. If ɛUV{\textless}fesc{\textgreater}{\textless}{\~{}}10- 7/ɛ*, positive feedback dominates, and small-halo objects constitute the bulk of the mass in stars and metals until at least redshift z{\~{}}10. Small-halo objects cannot reionize the universe because the feedback mechanism confines the H II regions inside the large-scale structure filaments. In contrast to massive objects (``large halos''), which can reionize voids, small-halo objects partially ionize only the dense filaments while leaving the voids mostly neutral.},

abstract = {Very high quality spectra of 24 metal-poor halo dwarfs and subgiants have been acquired with ESO's VLT/UVES for the purpose of determining Li isotopic abundances. The derived one-dimensional, non-LTE 7Li abundances from the Li I 670.8 nm line reveal a pronounced dependence on metallicity but with negligible scatter around this trend. Very good agreement is found between the abundances from the Li I 670.8 nm line and the Li I 610.4 nm line. The estimated primordial 7Li abundance is 7Li/H=(1.1-1.5)×10-10, which is a factor of 3-4 lower than predicted from standard big bang nucleosynthesis with the baryon density inferred from the cosmic microwave background. Interestingly, 6Li is detected in 9 of our 24 stars at the {\textgreater}=2 $\sigma$ significance level. Our observations suggest the existence of a 6Li plateau at the level of logɛ6Li{\~{}}0.8 however, taking into account predictions for 6Li destruction during the pre-main-sequence evolution tilts the plateau such that the 6Li abundances apparently increase with metallicity. Our most noteworthy result is the detection of 6Li in the very metal-poor star LP 815-43. Such a high 6Li abundance during these early Galactic epochs is very difficult to achieve by Galactic cosmic-ray spallation and $\alpha$-fusion reactions. It is concluded that both Li isotopes have a pre-Galactic origin. Possible 6Li production channels include protogalactic shocks and late-decaying or annihilating supersymmetric particles during the era of big bang nucleosynthesis. The presence of 6Li limits the possible degree of stellar 7Li depletion and thus sharpens the discrepancy with standard big bang nucleosynthesis.

Our sample of 33 relatively bright Y{\_}098-dropout galaxies have J{\_}125 band magnitudes between 25.5 and 27.4 mag. This is the largest sample of bright (J{\_}125 {\textless}{\~{}} 27.4) z{\~{}}8 galaxy candidates presented to date. Combining our dataset with the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF09) dataset, we constrain the rest-frame ultraviolet galaxy luminosity function at z{\~{}}8 over the widest dynamic range currently available. The combined datasets are well fitted by a Schechter function, i.e. $\backslash$phi(L) = $\backslash$phi{\_}* (L/L{\_}*){\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}$\backslash$ e{\^{}}{\{}-(L/L{\_}*){\}}, without evidence for an excess of sources at the bright end. At 68{\%} confidence, we derive $\backslash$phi{\_}* = (4.3{\^{}}{\{}+3.5{\}}{\_}{\{}-2.1{\}}) $\backslash$times 10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}} Mpc{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}, M{\_}* = -20.26{\^{}}{\{}+0.29{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.34{\}}, and a very steep faint-end slope $\backslash$alpha = -1.98{\^{}}{\{}+0.23{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.22{\}}. While the best-fit parameters still have a strong degeneracy, especially between $\backslash$phi{\_}* and M{\_}*, our improved coverage at the bright end has reduced the uncertainty of the faint-end power-law slope at z{\~{}}8 compared to the best previous determination at +/-0.4. With a future expansion of the BoRG survey, combined with planned ultradeep WFC3/IR observations, it will be possible to further reduce this uncertainty and clearly demonstrate the steepening of the faint-end slope compared to measurements at lower redshift, thereby confirming the key role played by small galaxies in the reionization of the universe.},

abstract = {We present a new method for estimating the H2 cooling rate in the optically thick regime in simulations of primordial star formation. Our new approach is based on the TreeCol algorithm, which projects matter distributions onto a spherical grid to create maps of column densities for each fluid element in the computational domain. We have improved this algorithm by using the relative gas velocities to weight the individual matter contributions with the relative spectral line overlaps, in order to properly account for the Doppler effect. We compare our new method to the widely used Sobolev approximation, which yields an estimate for the column density based on the local velocity gradient and the thermal velocity. This approach generally underestimates the photon escape probability because it neglects the density gradient and the actual shape of the cloud. We present a correction factor for the true line overlap in the Sobolev approximation and a new method based on local quantities, which fits the exact results reasonably well during the collapse of the cloud, with the error in the cooling rates always being less than 10{\%}. Analytical fitting formulae fail at determining the photon escape probability after formation of the first protostar (error of {\~{}}40{\%}) because they are based on the assumption of spherical symmetry and therefore break down once a protostellar accretion disk has formed. Our method yields lower temperatures and hence promotes fragmentation for densities above {\~{}}1010 cm-3 at a distance of {\~{}}200 AU from the first protostar. Since the overall accretion rates are hardly affected by the cooling implementation, we expect Pop III stars to have lower masses in our simulations, compared to the results of previous simulations that used the Sobolev approximation.},

abstract = {Numerical methods play an ever more important role in astrophysics. This is especially true in theoretical works, but of course, even in purely observational projects, data analysis without massive use of computational methods has become unthinkable. The key utility of computer simulations comes from their ability to solve complex systems of equations that are either intractable with analytic techniques or only amenable to highly approximative treatments. Simulations are best viewed as a powerful complement to analytic reasoning, and as the method of choice to model systems that feature enormous physical complexity such as star formation in evolving galaxies, the topic of this 43rd Saas Fee Advanced Course. The organizers asked me to lecture about high performance computing and numerical modelling in this winter school, and to specifically cover the basics of numerically treating gravity and hydrodynamics in the context of galaxy evolution. This is still a vast field, and I necessarily had to select a subset of the relevant material. The written notes presented here quite closely follow the lectures as held in Villars-sur-Ollon, which were meant to provide a general overview about some of the most pertinent techniques that may be relevant for students working on numerical models of galaxy evolution and star formation. The discussion is hence often at an introductory level, giving precedence to a presentation of the main numerical concepts rather than to a mathematically detailed exposition of the techniques.},

abstract = {The theory of first order Fermi acceleration at collisionless astrophysical shock fronts is reviewed. Observations suggest that shock waves in different astrophysical environments accelerate cosmic rays efficiently. In the first order process, high energy particles diffuse through Alfv{\'{e}}n waves that scatter them and couple them to the background plasma. These particles gain energy, on the average, every time they cross the schock front and bounce off approaching scattering centers. Calculations demonstrate that the distribution function transmitted by a plane shock is roughly a power law in momentum with slope similar to that inferred in galactic cosmic ray sources. The generation of the scattering Alfv{\'{e}}n waves by the streaming cosmic rays is described and it is argued that the wave amplitude is probably non-linear within sufficiently strong astrophysical shocks. Hydromagnetic scattering can operate on the thermal particles as well, possibly establishing the shock structure. This suggests a model of strong collisionless shocks in which high energy particles are inevitably produced very efficiently. Observable consequences of this model, together with its limitations and some alternatives, are described. Cosmic ray origin and astrophysical shocks can no longer be considered separately.},

The disk-averaged SFRs and gas densities for the combined sample are well represented by a Schmidt law with index N = 1.4+-0.15. The Schmidt law provides a surprisingly tight parametrization of the global star formation law, extending over several orders of magnitude in SFR and gas density. An alternative formulation of the star formation law, in which the SFR is presumed to scale with the ratio of the gas density to the average orbital timescale, also fits the data very well. Both descriptions provide potentially useful "recipes" for modelling the SFR in numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.},

We calculate the evolution of 6Li versus redshift generated from an initial burst of cosmological cosmic rays (CCRs) up to the formation of the Galaxy. We show that the pre-Galactic production of the 6Li isotope can account for the 6Li plateau observed in metal-poor halo stars without additional overproduction of 7Li. The derived relation between the amplitude of the CCR energy spectra and the redshift of the initial CCR production puts constraints on the physics and history of the objects, such as Population III stars, responsible for these early cosmic rays. Consequently, we consider the evolution of 6Li in the Galaxy. Since 6Li is also produced in Galactic cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis, we argue that halo stars with metallicities between [Fe/H]=-2 and -1 must be somewhat depleted in 6Li.},

This manuscript presents an easy-to-understand overview of different methods for error estimation that are applicable to both model-based and model-independent parameter estimates. These methods are not discussed in detail, but their basics are briefly outlined and their assumptions carefully noted. In particular, the methods for error estimation discussed are grid search, varying chi 2, the Fisher matrix, Monte-Carlo methods, error propagation, data resampling, and bootstrapping. Finally, a method is outlined how to propagate measurement errors through complex data-reduction pipelines.},

In standard Friedmann cosmological models, H2/H is approximately equal to 10 to the -6th, HD/H2 is approximately equal to 10 to the -4.5th, and LiH/H2 is approximately equal to 10 to the -6.5th. These molecules may dominate the cooling and trigger the collapse of primordial gas clouds. The dipole rotational transitions of HD and LiH are particularly important at high density and low temperature. Additional molecules form during spherical collapse of these clouds, and their rotational cooling keeps the gas temperature between 400 and 1500 K over 12 decades of density increase until the H2 lines becomes optically thick. The existence of molecular coolants at high redshift has significant implications for the first generation of stars and for thermal instabilities in intergalactic matter.},

abstract = {We study how the first galaxies were assembled under feedback from the accretion onto a central black hole (BH) that is left behind by the first generation of metal-free stars through self-consistent, cosmological simulations. X-ray radiation from the accretion of gas onto BH remnants of Population III (Pop III) stars, or from high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), again involving Pop III stars, influences the mode of second generation star formation. We track the evolution of the black hole accretion rate and the associated X-ray feedback starting with the death of the Pop III progenitor star inside a minihalo and following the subsequent evolution of the black hole as the minihalo grows to become an atomically cooling galaxy. We find that X-ray photoionization heating from a stellar-mass BH is able to quench further star formation in the host halo at all times before the halo enters the atomic cooling phase. X-ray radiation from a HMXB, assuming a luminosity close to the Eddington value, exerts an even stronger, and more diverse, feedback on star formation. It photoheats the gas inside the host halo, but also promotes the formation of molecular hydrogen and cooling of gas in the intergalactic medium and in nearby minihalos, leading to a net increase in the number of stars formed at early times. Our simulations further show that the radiative feedback from the first BHs may strongly suppress early BH growth, thus constraining models for the formation of supermassive BHs.},

abstract = {Lyman-alpha (Lya) photons generated from reprocessed ionizing photons in star-forming galaxies, once escaping from the interstellar medium, can encounter resonant scatterings with neutral hydrogen atoms in the circumgalactic and intergalactic media. Such a radiative transfer process tends to make Lya emission from high-redshift star-forming galaxies spatially extended. We present the prediction on the extended Lya emission from radiative transfer modeling of Lya emitting galaxies in a cosmological reionization simulation. We show that the extended emission can be detected from stacked narrowband images for both Lya emitters (LAEs) and Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). The surface brightness profile from the stacked image has two characteristic scales at tenths of Mpc and about 1 Mpc (comoving), respectively. The profile shows a central cusp below the inner characteristic scale, an approximate plateau between the two characteristic scales, and an extended tail beyond the outer characteristic scale. The profile is a superposition of the brightness distribution from the stacked sources themselves and that from neighboring clustered sources. The inner characteristic scale marks the transition between the two components, and the outer characteristic scale indicates the spatial extent of the scattered Lya emission from clustered sources. Both scales tend to increase with halo mass, ultraviolet luminosity, and observed Lya luminosity. Deep narrowband photometry from large ground-based telescopes is on the verge of detecting the extended Lya emission around LAEs and LBGs. The detection (or even null detection) would provide stringent tests on the radiative transfer model and interesting constraints on the physical environments (e.g., galactic wind and dust) of high-redshift star-forming galaxies.},

abstract = {We perform a large set of cosmological simulations of early structure formation and follow the formation and evolution of 1540 star-forming gas clouds to derive the mass distribution of primordial stars. The star formation in our cosmological simulations is characterized by two distinct populations, the so-called Population III.1 stars and primordial stars formed under the influence of far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation (Population III.2D stars). In this work, we determine the stellar masses by using the dependences on the physical properties of star-forming cloud and/or the external photodissociating intensity from nearby primordial stars, which are derived from the results of 2D radiation hydrodynamic simulations of protostellar feedback. The characteristic mass of the Pop III stars is found to be a few hundred solar masses at z ˜ 25, and it gradually shifts to lower masses with decreasing redshift. At high redshifts z {\textgreater} 20, about half of the star-forming gas clouds are exposed to intense FUV radiation and thus give birth to massive Pop III.2D stars. However, the local FUV radiation by nearby Pop III stars becomes weaker at lower redshifts, when typical Pop III stars have smaller masses and the mean physical separation between the stars becomes large owing to cosmic expansion. Therefore, at z {\textless} 20, a large fraction of the primordial gas clouds host Pop III.1 stars. At z ≲ 15, the Pop III.1 stars are formed in relatively cool gas clouds due to efficient radiative cooling by H2 and HD molecules; such stars have masses of a few × 10 M⊙. Since the stellar evolution and the final fate are determined by the stellar mass, Pop III stars formed at different epochs play different roles in the early universe.},

We consider the implications of various local and global feedback mechanisms using a set of models that bracket the severity of these effects to determine, qualitatively, how they may have influenced the global star formation rate and the details of hydrogen reionization. With relatively conservative assumptions, most of our models suggest that population III star formation proceeds in a self-regulated manner both locally and globally and, for a conventional $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, can significantly reionize the intergalactic medium between 15 {\textless}{\~{}}z{\textless}{\~{}} 20 as long as a large fraction of ionizing photons can escape from these earliest galaxies. We then combine these results with our earlier work focusing on the role of population II stars in galaxies with virial temperatures {\textgreater}{\~{}}104 K at redshifts 5 {\textless}{\~{}}z{\textless}{\~{}} 20. Hence, we construct a complete reionization history of the Universe that matches the Thomson optical depths as measured by the WMAP satellite as well as the evolution of the Gunn-Peterson optical depth as seen in the absorption spectra of the highest redshift quasars. We find that even with conservative estimates for the impact of negative feedback mechanisms, primordial stellar sources contribute significantly to early reionization. Future observations of a Thomson optical depth of $\tau$e{\textgreater}{\~{}} 0.13 would bolster the claim for the existence of population III stars similar to the ones studied here.},

abstract = {The spectra of the first galaxies and quasars in the universe should be strongly absorbed shortward of their rest-frame Ly$\alpha$ wavelength by neutral hydrogen (H I) in the intervening intergalactic medium. However, the Ly$\alpha$ line photons emitted by these sources are not eliminated but rather scatter until they redshift out of resonance and escape owing to the Hubble expansion of the surrounding intergalactic H I. We calculate the resulting brightness distribution and the spectral shape of the diffuse Ly$\alpha$ line emission around high-redshift sources before the intergalactic medium was reionized. Typically, the Ly$\alpha$ photons emitted by a source at z{\_}s{\~{}}10 scatter over a characteristic angular radius of {\~{}}15" around the source and compose a line that is broadened and redshifted by {\~{}}10{\^{}}3 km s{\^{}}-1 relative to the source. The scattered photons are highly polarized. Detection of the diffuse Ly$\alpha$ halos around high-redshift sources would provide a unique tool for probing the neutral intergalactic medium before the epoch of reionization. On sufficiently large scales, where the Hubble flow is smooth and the gas is neutral, the Ly$\alpha$ brightness distribution can be used to determine the cosmological mass densities of baryons and matter.},

abstract = {We present results from the first cosmological simulations which study the onset of primordial, metal-free (population III), cosmic star formation and the transition to the present-day, metal-rich star formation (population II-I), including molecular (H2, HD, etc.) evolution, tracing the injection of metals by supernov{\ae} (SNe) into the surrounding intergalactic medium and following the change in the initial mass function (IMF) according to the metallicity of the corresponding stellar population. Our investigation addresses the role of a wide variety of parameters (critical metallicity for the transition, IMF slope and range, SN/pair-instability SN metal yields, star formation threshold, resolution, etc.) on the metal-enrichment history and the associated transition in the star formation mode. All simulations present common trends. Metal enrichment is very patchy, with rare, unpolluted regions surviving at all redshifts, inducing the simultaneous presence of metal-free and metal-rich star formation regimes. As a result of the rapid pollution within high-density regions due to the first SN/pair-instability SN, local metallicity is quickly boosted above the critical metallicity for the transition. For this reason, population III stars dominate only during the very first stages of structure formation, with an average contribution to the total star formation rate that reaches a constant value of {\~{}}10-3 at redshift {\~{}}11-13. If primordial supenov{\ae} consisted only of type II ones, the contribution would be {\~{}}10-1. Interestingly, the above conclusions are independent from many poorly constrained parameters.},

These observations translate into constraints on the strength and scale magnetic fields must have during the early stages of galaxy formation in order to seed the galactic dynamo. We examine mechanisms for the generation of magnetic fields that operate prior during inflation and during subsequent phase transitions such as electroweak symmetry breaking and the quark-hadron phase transition. The implications of strong primordial magnetic fields for the reionization epoch as well as the first generation of stars are discussed in detail. The exotic, early-Universe mechanisms are contrasted with astrophysical processes that generate fields after recombination. For example, a Biermann-type battery can operate in a proto-galaxy during the early stages of structure formation. Moreover, magnetic fields in either an early generation of stars or active galactic nuclei can be dispersed into the intergalactic medium.},

abstract = {Population III stars first form in dark matter halos with masses around 10{\^{}}6 Msun. By definition, they are metal-free, and their protostellar collapse is driven by molecular hydrogen cooling in the gas-phase, leading to a massive characteristic mass {\~{}}100 Msun and suppressed fragmentation. Population II stars with lower characteristic masses form when the star-forming gas reaches a critical metallicity of 10{\^{}}{\{}-6{\}} - 10{\^{}}{\{}-3.5{\}} Zsun, depending on whether dust cooling is important. We present adaptive mesh refinement radiation hydrodynamics simulations that follows the transition from Population III to II star formation. We model stellar radiative feedback with adaptive ray tracing. A top-heavy initial mass function for the Population III stars is considered, resulting in a plausible distribution of pair-instability supernovae and associated metal enrichment. We find that the gas fraction recovers from 5 percent to nearly the cosmic fraction in halos with merger histories rich in halos above 10{\^{}}7 Msun. A single pair-instability supernova is sufficient to enrich the host halo to a metallicity floor of 10{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}} Zsun and to transition to Population II star formation. This provides a natural explanation for the observed floor on damped Lyman alpha (DLA) systems metallicities reported in the literature, which is of this order. We find that stellar metallicities do not necessarily trace stellar ages, as mergers of halos with established stellar populations can create superpositions of t-Z evolutionary tracks. A bimodal metallicity distribution is created after a starburst occurs when the halo can cool efficiently through atomic line cooling.},

abstract = {The ability of primordial gas to cool in protogalactic haloes exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is critically dependent on the self-shielding of H2. We perform radiative transfer calculations of LW line photons, post-processing outputs from three-dimensional adaptive mesh refinement simulations of haloes with Tvir≳ 104 K at z ˜ 10. We calculate the optically thick photodissociation rate numerically, including the effects of density, temperature and velocity gradients in the gas, as well as line overlap and shielding of H2 by H I, over a large number of sightlines. In low-density regions (n ≲ 104 cm-3) the dissociation rates exceed those obtained using most previous approximations by more than an order of magnitude; the correction is smaller at higher densities. We trace the origin of the deviations primarily to inaccuracies of (i) the most common fitting formula for the suppression of the dissociation rate, from Draine and Bertoldi and (ii) estimates for the effective shielding column density from local properties of the gas. The combined effects of gas temperature and velocity gradients are comparatively less important, typically altering the spherically averaged rate only by a factor of ≲2. We present a simple modification to the Draine {\&} Bertoldi fitting formula for the optically thick rate which improves agreement with our numerical results to within ˜15 per cent, and can be adopted in future simulations. We find that estimates for the effective shielding column can be improved by using the local Sobolev length. Our correction to the H2 self-shielding reduces the critical LW flux to suppress H2 cooling in Tvir≳ 104 K haloes by an order of magnitude; this increases the number of such haloes in which supermassive (M ˜ 105 Msun) black holes may have formed.},

However, the modifications are not dramatic, and the typical Jeans mass within the halo is conserved throughout the collapse, for all the DM parameters we have considered. This result implies that the presence of DM annihilations does not substantially modify the initial mass function of the first stars, with respect to the standard case in which such additional energy term is not taken into account. We find also that when the rate of energy produced by the DM annihilations and absorbed by the gas equals the chemical cooling (at densities yet far from the actual formation of a protostellar core) the structure does not halt its collapse, although that proceeds more slowly by a factor smaller than few per cent of the total collapse time.},

abstract = {We describe the newly written code GADGET which is suitable both for cosmological simulations of structure formation and for the simulation of interacting galaxies. GADGET evolves self-gravitating collisionless fluids with the traditional N-body approach, and a collisional gas by smoothed particle hydrodynamics. Along with the serial version of the code, we discuss a parallel version that has been designed to run on massively parallel supercomputers with distributed memory. While both versions use a tree algorithm to compute gravitational forces, the serial version of GADGET can optionally employ the special-purpose hardware GRAPE instead of the tree. Periodic boundary conditions are supported by means of an Ewald summation technique. The code uses individual and adaptive timesteps for all particles, and it combines this with a scheme for dynamic tree updates. Due to its Lagrangian nature, GADGET thus allows a very large dynamic range to be bridged, both in space and time. So far, GADGET has been successfully used to run simulations with up to 7.5×10 7 particles, including cosmological studies of large-scale structure formation, high-resolution simulations of the formation of clusters of galaxies, as well as workstation-sized problems of interacting galaxies. In this study, we detail the numerical algorithms employed, and show various tests of the code. We publicly release both the serial and the massively parallel version of the code.},

abstract = {Evolution in the X-ray luminosity -- star formation rate ({\$}L{\_}X{\$}-SFR) relation could provide the first evidence of a top-heavy stellar initial mass function in the early universe, as the abundance of high-mass stars and binary systems are both expected to increase with decreasing metallicity. The sky-averaged (global) 21-cm signal has the potential to test this prediction via constraints on the thermal history of the intergalactic medium, since X-rays can most easily escape galaxies and heat gas on large scales. A significant complication in the interpretation of upcoming 21-cm measurements is the unknown spectrum of accreting black holes at high-{\$}z{\$}, which depends on the mass of accreting objects and poorly constrained processes such as how accretion disk photons are processed by the disk atmosphere and host galaxy interstellar medium. Using a novel approach to solving the cosmological radiative transfer equation (RTE), we show that reasonable changes in the characteristic BH mass affects the amplitude of the 21-cm signal's minimum at the {\$}\backslashsim 10-20{\$} mK level --- comparable to errors induced by commonly used approximations to the RTE --- while modifications to the intrinsic disk spectrum due to Compton scattering (bound-free absorption) can shift the position of the minimum of the global signal by {\$}\backslashDelta z \backslashapprox 0.5{\$} ({\$}\backslashDelta z \backslashapprox 2{\$}), and modify its amplitude by up to {\$}\backslashapprox 10{\$} mK ({\$}\backslashapprox 50{\$} mK) for a given accretion history. Such deviations are larger than the uncertainties expected of current global 21-cm signal extraction algorithms, and could easily be confused with evolution in the {\$}L{\_}X{\$}-SFR relation.},

abstract = {[Abridged] We present a new grid of massive population III star models including the effects of rotation on the stellar structure and chemical mixing, and magnetic torques for the transport of angular momentum. Based on the grid, we also present a phase diagram for the expected final fates of rotating massive Pop III stars. Our non-rotating models become redder than the previous models in the literature, given the larger overshooting parameter adopted in this study. In particular, convective dredge-up of the helium core material into the hydrogen envelope is observed in our non-rotating very massive star models ({\textgreater}{\~{}}200 Msun), which is potentially important for the chemical yields. On the other hand, the stars become bluer and more luminous with a higher rotational velocity. With the Spruit-Tayler dynamo, our models with a sufficiently high initial rotational velocity can reach the critical rotation earlier and lose more mass as a result, compared to the previous models without magnetic fields. The most dramatic effect of rotation is found with the so-called chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE), which is observed for a limited mass and rotational velocity range. CHE has several important consequences: 1) Both primary nitrogen and ionizing photons are abundantly produced. 2) Conditions for gamma-ray burst progenitors are fulfilled for an initial mass range of 13 - 84 Msun. 3) Pair instability supernovae of type Ibc are expected for 84 -190 Msun and 4) Both a pulsational pair instability supernova and a GRB may occur from the same progenitor of about 56 - 84 Msun, which might significantly influence the consequent GRB afterglow. We find that CHE does not occur for very massive stars ({\textgreater} 190 Msun), in which case the hydrogen envelope expands to the red-supergiant phase and the final angular momentum is too low to make any explosive event powered by rotation.},

abstract = {We study the effects of external ionization by cosmic rays (CRs) and X-rays on the thermal evolution of primordial clouds under strong far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation. A strong FUV radiation field photodissociates H2 and quenches its cooling. Even in such an environment, a massive cloud with virial temperature {\textgreater}rsim104 K can contract isothermally at 8000 K by hydrogen Lyman $\alpha$ cooling. This cloud collapses monolithically without fragmentation, and a supermassive star ({\textgreater}rsim105 Msun) is believed to form at the centre, which eventually evolves into a supermassive black hole (SMBH). However, candidates of FUV sources, including star-forming galaxies, are probably sources of strong CRs and X-rays too. We find that external ionization promotes H2 production and elevates the threshold FUV intensity Jcrit needed for SMBH formation for CR energy density UCR {\textgreater} rsim 10-14 erg cm-3 or X-ray intensity JX {\textgreater} rsim 10-24 erg s-1 cm-2 sr-1 Hz-1 at 1 keV. The critical FUV flux increases as Jcrit∝UCR1/2 (∝JX1/2) in the high CR (respectively X-ray) limit. With the same value of FUV intensity at the Lyman limit (13.6 eV), the H- photodissociation rate, with a threshold of 0.755 eV, increases and the H2 abundance decreases with decreasing effective temperature of the FUV sources T*. A lower value of T* thus results in a lower critical FUV flux Jcrit at the Lyman limit. Using an empirical relation between the intensities of FUV and CRs/X-rays from nearby star-forming galaxies, we find that the external ionization effect remarkably enhances the critical FUV flux for sources with T* as high as 105 K and composed of stars with mass ≲100 Msun to a level that is not realized in any halo. This indicates that to induce SMBH formation the FUV sources must be either Population II/I galaxies with low brightness temperature (T*˜ 104 K), Population III galaxies (T*˜ 105 K) with a very top-heavy initial mass function or Population III galaxies too young to harbour sources of CRs/X-rays, for example supernova remnants or high-mass X-ray binaries.},

abstract = {The extremely luminous supernova SN 2006gy (ref. 1) challenges the traditional view that the collapse of a stellar core is the only mechanism by which a massive star makes a supernova, because it seems too luminous by more than a factor of ten. Here we report that the brightest supernovae in the modern Universe arise from collisions between shells of matter ejected by massive stars that undergo an interior instability arising from the production of electron-positron pairs. This 'pair instability' leads to explosive burning that is insufficient to unbind the star, but ejects many solar masses of the envelope. After the first explosion, the remaining core contracts and searches for a stable burning state. When the next explosion occurs, several solar masses of material are again ejected, which collide with the earlier ejecta. This collision can radiate 10(50) erg of light, about a factor of ten more than an ordinary supernova. Our model is in good agreement with the observed light curve for SN 2006gy and also shows that some massive stars can produce more than one supernova-like outburst.},

abstract = {Within the precise cosmological framework provided by the Lambda-Cold Dark Matter model and standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis, the chemical evolution of the pregalactic gas can now be followed with accuracy limited only by the uncertainties on the reaction rates. Starting during the recombination era, the formation of the first molecules and molecular ions containing hydrogen, deuterium, helium, and lithium was severely hindered by the low density of the expanding universe, the intensity of the cosmic radiation field, and the absence of solid catalyzers. Molecular hydrogen and deuterated hydrogen, the most abundant species formed in the gas phase prior to structure formation, played a fundamental role in the cooling of the gas clouds that gave birth to the first stellar generation, contributing to determine the scale of fragmentation. Primordial molecules also interacted with the photons of the cosmic background via resonant scattering, absorption and emission. In this review we examine the current status of the chemistry of the early universe and discuss the most relevant reactions for which uncertainties still exist from theory or laboratory experiments. The prospects for detecting spectral distortions or spatial anisotropies due to the first atoms and molecules are also addressed.},

abstract = {In typical astrophysical environments, the abundance of heavy elements ranges from 0.001 to 2 times the solar value. Lower abundances have been seen in selected stars in the Milky Way's halo and in two quasar absorption systems at redshift z = 3 (ref. 4). These are widely interpreted as relics from the early Universe, when all gas possessed a primordial chemistry. Before now there have been no direct abundance measurements from the first billion years after the Big Bang, when the earliest stars began synthesizing elements. Here we report observations of hydrogen and heavy-element absorption in a spectrum of a quasar at z = 7.04, when the Universe was just 772 million years old (5.6 per cent of its present age). We detect a large column of neutral hydrogen but no corresponding metals (defined as elements heavier than helium), limiting the chemical abundance to less than 1/10,000 times the solar level if the gas is in a gravitationally bound proto-galaxy, or to less than 1/1,000 times the solar value if it is diffuse and unbound. If the absorption is truly intergalactic, it would imply that the Universe was neither ionized by starlight nor chemically enriched in this neighbourhood at z ≈ 7. If it is gravitationally bound, the inferred abundance is too low to promote efficient cooling, and the system would be a viable site to form the predicted but as yet unobserved massive population III stars.},

abstract = {We numerically study the mutual interaction between dark matter (DM) and Population III (Pop III) stellar systems in order to explore the possibility of Pop III dark stars within this physical scenario. We perform a cosmological simulation, initialized at z˜ 100, which follows the evolution of gas and DM. We analyse the formation of the first minihalo at z˜ 20 and the subsequent collapse of the gas to densities of 1012 cm-3. We then use this simulation to initialize a set of smaller scale 'cut-out' simulations in which we further refine the DM to have spatial resolution similar to that of the gas. We test multiple DM density profiles, and we employ the sink particle method to represent the accreting star-forming region. We find that, for a range of DM configurations, the motion of the Pop III star-disc system serves to separate the positions of the protostars with respect to the DM density peak, such that there is insufficient DM to influence the formation and evolution of the protostars for more than ˜5000 years. In addition, the star-disc system causes gravitational scattering of the central DM to lower densities, further decreasing the influence of DM over time. Any DM-powered phase of Pop III stars will thus be very short-lived for the typical multiple system, and DM will not serve to significantly prolong the life of Pop III stars.},

abstract = {Using observed star formation rates at redshifts up to z {\~{}} 5, we calculate cosmic supernova rates for core collapse and Type Ia supernovae. Together with supernova statistics and detailed light curves, we estimate the number of supernovae, and their distribution in redshift, that should be detectable in different filters with various instruments, including both existing and future telescopes, in particular the NGST. We find that the NGST should detect several tens of core collapse supernovae in a single frame. Most of these will be core collapse supernovae with 1 {\textless}{\~{}} z {\textless}{\~{}} 2, but about one third will have z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 2. Rates at z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 5 are highly uncertain. For ground based 8-10 m class telescopes we predict {\~{}} 0.1 supernova per square arcmin to IAB = 27, with about twice as many core collapse SNe as Type Ia's. The typical redshift will be z {\~{}} 1, with an extended tail up to z {\~{}} 2. Detectability of high redshift supernovae from ground is highly sensitive to the rest frame UV flux of the supernova, where line blanketing may decrease the rates severely in filters below 1 mu m. In addition to the standard `Madau' star formation rate, we discuss alternative models with flat star formation rate at high redshifts. Especially for supernovae at z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 2 the rates of these models differ considerably, when seen as a function of redshift. An advantage of using SNe to study the instantaneous star formation rate is that the SN rest frame optical to NIR is less affected by dust extinction than the UV-light. However, if a large fraction of the star formation occurs in galaxies with a very large extinction the observed SN rate will be strongly affected. An additional advantage of using SNe is that these are not sensitive to selection effects caused by low surface brightness. Different aspects of the search strategy is discussed, and it is especially pointed out that unless the time interval between the observations spans at least 100 days for ground based searches, and one year for NGST, a large fraction of the Type IIP supernovae will be lost. Because of the time delay between the formation of the progenitor star and the explosion, observations of z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 1 Type Ia supernovae may distinguish different progenitor scenarios. A major problem is the determination of the redshift of these faint supernovae, and various alternatives are discussed, including photometric redshifts. In practice a reliable classification based on either spectroscopy or light curves requires the SNe to be {\~{}} 2 magnitudes above the detection limit. The uncertainties in the estimates are discussed extensively. We also discuss how the estimated rates depend on cosmology. Finally, some comments on effects of metallicity are included.},

abstract = {We use high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) simulations to predict the characteristics of Ly$\alpha$ emission from the cold gas streams that fed galaxies in massive haloes at high redshift. The Ly$\alpha$ luminosity in our simulations is powered by the release of gravitational energy as gas flows from the intergalactic medium into the halo potential wells. The ultraviolet UV background contributes only {\textless}20per cent to the gas heating. The Ly$\alpha$ emissivity is due primarily to electron-impact excitation cooling radiation in gas at {\~{}}2 × 104 K. We calculate the Ly$\alpha$ emissivities assuming collisional ionization equilibrium at all gas temperatures. The simulated streams are self-shielded against the UV background, so photoionization and recombination contribute negligibly to the Ly$\alpha$ line formation. We produce theoretical maps of the Ly$\alpha$ surface brightnesses, assuming that {\~{}}85per cent of the Ly$\alpha$ photons are directly observable. We do not consider transfer of the Ly$\alpha$ radiation, nor do we include the possible effects of internal sources of photoionization such as star-forming regions. Dust absorption is expected to obscure a small fraction of the luminosity in the streams. We find that typical haloes of mass Mv {\~{}} 1012-1013Msolar at z {\~{}} 3 emit as Ly$\alpha$ blobs (LABs) with luminosities 1043-1044ergs-1. Most of the Ly$\alpha$ comes from the extended (50-100kpc) narrow, partly clumpy, inflowing, cold streams of (1-5) × 104K that feed the growing galaxies. The predicted LAB morphology is therefore irregular, with dense clumps and elongated extensions. The integrated area contained within surface brightness isophotes of 2 × 10-18ergs-1cm-2arcsec-2 is {\~{}}2-100arcsec2, consistent with observations. The linewidth is expected to range from 102 to more than 103kms-1 with a large variance. The typical Ly$\alpha$ surface brightness profile is {\~{}} r-1.2 where r is the distance from the halo centre. Our simulated LABs are similar in luminosity, morphology and extent to the observed LABs, with distinct kinematic features. The predicted Ly$\alpha$ luminosity function is consistent with observations, and the predicted areas and linewidths roughly recover the observed scaling relations. This mechanism for producing LABs appears inevitable in many high-z galaxies, though it may work in parallel with other mechanisms. Some of the LABs may thus be regarded as direct detections of the cold streams that drove galaxy evolution at high z.},

In contrast to previous theories, capture and loss are taken explicitly into account and it is shown that they cause a considerable extension of the range over which the mean specific energy is nearly constant.

abstract = {Diffuse interstellar clouds show large abundances of H+ 3 which can only be maintained by a high ionization rate of H2. Cosmic rays are the dominant ionization mechanism in this environment, so the large ionization rate implies a high cosmic-ray flux, and a large amount of energy residing in cosmic rays. In this paper, we find that the standard propagated cosmic-ray spectrum predicts an ionization rate much lower than that inferred from H+ 3. Low-energy ({\~{}}10 MeV) cosmic rays are the most efficient at ionizing hydrogen, but cannot be directly detected; consequently, an otherwise unobservable enhancement of the low-energy cosmic-ray flux offers a plausible explanation for the H+ 3 results. Beyond ionization, cosmic rays also interact with the interstellar medium by spalling atomic nuclei and exciting atomic nuclear states. These processes produce the light elements Li, Be, and B, as well as gamma-ray lines. To test the consequences of an enhanced low-energy cosmic-ray flux, we adopt two physically motivated cosmic-ray spectra which by construction reproduce the ionization rate inferred in diffuse clouds, and investigate the implications of these spectra on dense cloud ionization rates, light-element abundances, gamma-ray fluxes, and energetics. One spectrum proposed here provides an explanation for the high ionization rate seen in diffuse clouds while still appearing to be broadly consistent with other observables, but the shape of this spectrum suggests that supernovae remnants may not be the predominant accelerators of low-energy cosmic rays.},

abstract = {Massive (stellar mass M sstarf {\textgreater}{\~{}} 3 × 1010 M sun), passively evolving galaxies at redshifts z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 1 exhibit on average physical sizes smaller, by factors ≈3, than local early-type galaxies (ETGs) endowed with the same stellar mass. Small sizes are in fact expected on theoretical grounds, if dissipative collapse occurs. Recent results show that the size evolution at z {\textless}{\~{}} 1 is limited to less than 40{\%}, while most of the evolution occurs at z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 1, where both compact and already extended galaxies are observed and the scatter in size is remarkably larger than it is locally. The presence at high redshift of a significant number of ETGs with the same size as their local counterparts, as well as ETGs with quite small size (lsim1/10 of the local one), points to a timescale for reaching the new, expanded equilibrium configuration of less than the Hubble time tH (z). We demonstrate that the projected mass of compact, high-redshift galaxies and that of local ETGs within the same physical radius, the nominal half-luminosity radius of high-redshift ETGs, differ substantially in that the high-redshift ETGs are on average significantly denser. This result suggests that the physical mechanism responsible for the size increase should also remove mass from central galaxy regions (r {\textless}{\~{}} 1 kpc). We propose that quasar activity, which peaks at redshift z {\~{}} 2, can remove large amounts of gas from central galaxy regions on a timescale shorter than the triggering a puffing up of the stellar component at constant stellar mass (or a timescale on the order of the dynamical one); in this case, the size increase goes together with a decrease in the central mass. The size evolution is expected to parallel that of the quasars and the inverse hierarchy, or downsizing, seen in the quasar evolution is mirrored in the size evolution. Exploiting the virial theorem, we derive the relation between the stellar velocity dispersion of ETGs and the characteristic velocity of their hosting halos at the time of formation and collapse. By combining this relation with the halo formation rate at z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 1, we predict the local velocity dispersion distribution function. On comparing it to the observed one, we show that velocity dispersion evolution of massive ETGs is fully compatible with the observed average evolution in size at constant stellar mass. Less massive ETGs (with stellar masses M sstarf {\textless}{\~{}} 3 × 1010 M sun) are expected to evolve less both in size and in velocity dispersion, because their evolution is essentially determined by supernova feedback, which cannot yield winds as powerful as those triggered by quasars. The differential evolution is expected to leave imprints in the size versus luminosity/mass, velocity dispersion versus luminosity/mass, and central black hole mass versus velocity dispersion relationships, as observed in local ETGs.},

@article{GloverSavin2009,
abstract = {Studies of the formation of metal-free Population III stars usually focus primarily on the role played by H2 cooling, on account of its large chemical abundance relative to other possible molecular or ionic coolants. However, while H2 is generally the most important coolant at low gas densities, it is not an effective coolant at high gas densities, owing to the low critical density at which it reaches local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and to the large opacities that develop in its emission lines. It is therefore possible that emission from other chemical species may play an important role in cooling high-density primordial gas. A particularly interesting candidate is the H+3 molecular ion. This ion has an LTE cooling rate that is roughly a billion times larger than that of H2, and unlike other primordial molecular ions such as H +2 or HeH+, it is not easily removed from the gas by collisions with H or H2. It is already known to be an important coolant in at least one astrophysical context - the upper atmospheres of gas giants - but its role in the cooling of primordial gas has received little previous study. In this paper, we investigate the potential importance of H+3 cooling in primordial gas using a newly developed H+3 cooling function and the most detailed model of primordial chemistry published to date. We show that although H+3 is, in most circumstances, the third most important coolant in dense primordial gas (after H2 and HD), it is nevertheless unimportant, as it contributes no more than a few per cent of the total cooling. We also show that in gas irradiated by a sufficiently strong flux of cosmic rays or X-rays, H+3 can become the dominant coolant in the gas, although the size of the flux required renders this scenario unlikely to occur.},

abstract = {It is well known that cosmic rays contribute significantly to the pressure of the interstellar medium in our own Galaxy, suggesting that they may play an important role in regulating star formation during the formation and evolution of galaxies. We here discuss a novel numerical treatment of the physics of cosmic rays and its implementation in the parallel smoothed particle hydrodynamics code GADGET-2. In our methodology, the non-thermal cosmic ray population of each gaseous fluid element is approximated by a simple power law spectrum in particle momentum, characterized by an amplitude, a cut-off, and a fixed slope. Adiabatic compression and a number of physical source and sink terms are modelled which modify the cosmic ray pressure of each particle. The most important sources considered are injection by supernovae and diffusive shock acceleration, while the primary sinks are thermalization by Coulomb interactions, and catastrophic losses by hadronic interactions. We also include diffusion of cosmic rays. Using a number of test problems, we show that our scheme is numerically robust and efficient, allowing us to carry out the first cosmological structure formation simulations that account for cosmic ray physics, together with radiative cooling and star formation. In simulations of isolated galaxies, we find that cosmic rays can significantly reduce the star formation efficiencies of small galaxies, with virial velocities below 80 km s-1, an effect that becomes progressively stronger towards low-mass scales. In cosmological simulations of the formation of dwarf galaxies at high redshift, we find that the total mass-to-light ratio of small halos and the faint end of the luminosity function are affected. The latter becomes slightly flatter. When cosmic ray acceleration in shock waves is followed as well, we find that up to 40{\%} of the energy dissipated at structure formation shocks can appear as cosmic ray pressure at redshifts around z˜ 3{\{}-{\}}6, but this fraction drops to 10{\%} at low redshifts when the shock distribution becomes increasingly dominated by lower Mach numbers. Despite this large cosmic ray energy content in the high-redshift intergalactic medium, the flux power spectrum of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest is only affected on very small scales of k{\textgreater}0.1 km-1s, and at a weak level of 5{\{}-{\}}15{\%}. Within virialized objects, we find lower contributions of CR-pressure, due to the increased efficiency of loss processes at higher densities, the lower Mach numbers of shocks inside halos, and the softer adiabatic index of CRs, which disadvantages them when a composite of thermal gas and cosmic rays is adiabatically compressed. The total energy in cosmic rays relative to the thermal energy within the virial radius drops from 20{\%} for 1012 h-1 {\{}M{\}}{\_}⊙ halos to 5{\%} for rich galaxy clusters of mass 1015 h-1 {\{}M{\}}{\_}⊙ in non-radiative simulations. Interestingly, the lower effective adiabatic index also increases the compressibility of the intrahalo medium, an effect that slightly increases the central concentration of the gas and the baryon fraction within the virial radius. We find that this can enhance the cooling rate onto central cluster galaxies, even though the galaxies in the cluster periphery become slightly less luminous as a result of cosmic ray feedback.},

abstract = {We present simulations of the magnetized interstellar medium (ISM) in models of massive star-forming (40 M ⊙ yr-1) disk galaxies with high gas surface densities ($\Sigma$gas {\~{}} 100 M ⊙ pc-2) similar to observed star-forming high-redshift disks. We assume that type II supernovae deposit 10{\%} of their energy into the ISM as cosmic rays (CRs) and neglect the additional deposition of thermal energy or momentum. With a typical Galactic diffusion coefficient for CRs (3 × 1028 cm2 s-1), we demonstrate that this process alone can trigger the local formation of a strong low-density galactic wind maintaining vertically open field lines. Driven by the additional pressure gradient of the relativistic fluid, the wind speed can exceed 103 km s-1, much higher than the escape velocity of the galaxy. The global mass loading, i.e., the ratio of the gas mass leaving the galactic disk in a wind to the star formation rate, becomes of order unity once the system has settled into an equilibrium. We conclude that relativistic particles accelerated in supernova remnants alone provide a natural and efficient mechanism to trigger winds similar to observed mass-loaded galactic winds in high-redshift galaxies. These winds also help in explaining the low efficiencies for the conversion of gas into stars in galaxies, as well as the early enrichment of the intergalactic medium with metals. This mechanism may be at least of similar importance to the traditionally considered momentum feedback from massive stars and thermal and kinetic feedback from supernova explosions.},

abstract = {While the average metallicity of the intergalactic medium rises above Z gsim 10-3 Z sun by the end of the reionization, pockets of metal-free gas can still exist at later times. We quantify the presence of a long tail in the formation rate of metal-free halos during late stages of reionization (redshift z ≈ 6), which might offer the best window to detect Population III stars. Using cosmological simulations for the growth of dark matter halos, coupled with analytical recipes for the metal enrichment of their interstellar medium, we show that pockets of metal-free gas exist at z ≈ 6 even under the assumption of high efficiency in metal pollution via winds. A comoving metal-free halo formation rate d 2 n/dt dV gsim 10-9 Mpc-3 yr-1 is expected at z = 6 for halos with virial temperature T vir ≈ 104 K (mass {\~{}}108 M sun), sufficient to initiate cooling even with strong negative radiative feedback. These halos will appear as absorption systems with a typical hydrogen column density of {\~{}}1020 cm-2, a sky covering factor 5 × 10-3 and a number density of 25 arcmin-2 for 5.5 {\textless}= z {\textless}= 6.5. Under the assumption of a single Population III supernova (SN) formed per metal-free halo, we expect an observed supernova rate of 2.6 × 10-3 deg-2 yr-1 in the same redshift range. These metal-free stars and their SNe will be isolated and outside galaxies (at distances gsim150 h -1 kpc) and thus significantly less biased than the general population of {\~{}}108 M sun halos at z ≈ 6. SN searches for metal-free explosions must thus rely on large area surveys. If metal-free stars produce very luminous SNe, like SN2006gy, then a multi-epoch survey reaching m AB = 27 at 1 $\mu$m is sufficient for detecting them at z = 6. While the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will not reach this depth in the z band, it will be able to detect several tens of Population III SNe in the i and r bands at z lsim 5.5, when their observed rate is down to 3-8 × 10-4 deg-2 yr-1.},

abstract = {We use cosmological simulations to assess how the explosion of the first stars in supernovae (SNe) influences early cosmic history. Specifically, we investigate the impact by SNe on the host systems for Population III (Pop III) star formation and explore its dependence on halo environment and Pop III progenitor mass. We then trace the evolution of the enriched gas until conditions are met to trigger second-generation star formation. To this extent, we quantify the recovery time-scale, which measures the time delay between a Pop III SN explosion and the appearance of cold, dense gas, out of which second-generation stars can form. We find that this time-scale is highly sensitive to the Pop III progenitor mass, and less so to the halo environment. For Pop III progenitor masses, M* = 15, 25, and 40 M⊙ in a halo of 5 × 105 M⊙, recovery times are ˜10, 25, and 90 Myr, respectively. For more massive progenitors, including those exploding in pair instability SNe, second-generation star formation is delayed significantly, for up to a Hubble time. The dependence of the recovery time on the mass of the SN progenitor is mainly due to the ionizing impact of the progenitor star. Photoionization heating increases the gas pressure and initiates a hydrodynamical response that reduces the central gas density, an effect that is stronger in more massive. The gas around lower mass Pop III stars remains denser and hence the SN remnants cool more rapidly, facilitating the subsequent re-condensation of the gas and formation of a second generation of stars. In most cases, the second-generation stars are already metal enriched to ˜2-5 × 10-4 Z⊙, thus belonging to Pop II. The recovery time-scale is a key quantity governing the nature of the first galaxies, able to host low-mass, long-lived stellar systems. These in turn are the target of future deep-field campaigns with the James Webb Space Telescope.},

In this paper we study the impact of an X-ray background, such as high-energy photons from early quasars, on the temperature and ionization of the IGM prior to reionization, before the fully ionized bubbles associated with individual sources have overlapped. X-rays have large mean free paths relative to EUV photons, and their photoelectrons can have significant effects on the thermal and ionization balance. We find that hydrogen ionization is dominated by the X-ray photoionization of neutral helium and the resulting secondary electrons. Thus, the IGM may have been warm and weakly ionized prior to full reionization. We examine several related consequences, including the filtering of the baryonic Jeans mass scale, signatures in the cosmic microwave background, and the H--catalyzed production of molecular hydrogen.},

As a general feature, the IMF is well described by a power-law form for mga 1 msol and a lognormal form below. The extension of the disk IMF into the brown dwarf (BD) regime is in good agreement with observations and yields a disk BD number-density comparable to the stellar one sim 0.1 pc3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. Within all the uncertainties, it is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters, and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk. The IMF characteristic of early star formation remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below sim 1 msol. These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The M/L ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8 and 1.4 smaller than a Salpeter IMF, respectively. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. (shortened)},

abstract = {Simulations predict that the first stars in a $\Lambda$CDM universe formed at redshifts z{\textgreater}20 in minihalos with masses of about 106 Msolar. We have studied their radiative feedback by simulating the propagation of ionization fronts (I-fronts) created by these first Population III stars (M*=15-500 Msolar) at z=20, within the density field of a cosmological simulation of primordial star formation, outward through the host minihalo and into the surrounding gas. A three-dimensional ray-tracing calculation tracks the I-front once the H II region evolves a ``champagne flow'' inside the minihalo, after the early D-type I-front detaches from the shock and runs ahead, becoming R type. We take account of the hydrodynamic back-reaction by an approximate model of the central wind. We find that the escape fraction of ionizing radiation from the host halo increases with stellar mass, with 0.7{\textless}{\~{}}fesc{\textless}{\~{}}0.9 for 80{\textless}{\~{}}M*/Msolar{\textless}{\~{}}500. To quantify the ionizing efficiency of these stars as they begin cosmic reionization, we find that for M*{\textgreater}{\~{}}80 Msolar, the ratio of gas mass ionized to stellar mass is {\~{}}60,000, roughly half the number of ionizing photons released per stellar baryon. Nearby minihalos are shown to trap the I-front, so their centers remain neutral. This is contrary to the recent suggestion that these stars would trigger formation of a second generation by fully ionizing neighboring minihalos, stimulating H2 formation in their cores. Finally, we discuss how the evacuation of gas from the host halo reduces the growth and luminosity of ``miniquasars'' that may form from black hole remnants of the first stars.},

abstract = {We review current understanding of star formation, outlining an overall theoretical framework and the observations that motivate it. A conception of star formation has emerged in which turbulence plays a dual role, both creating overdensities to initiate gravitational contraction or collapse, and countering the effects of gravity in these overdense regions. The key dynamical processes involved in star formation - turbulence, magnetic fields, and self-gravity - are highly nonlinear and multidimensional. Physical arguments are used to identify and explain the features and scalings involved in star formation, and results from numerical simulations are used to quantify these effects. We divide star formation into large-scale and small-scale regimes and review each in turn. Large scales range from galaxies to giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and their substructures. Important problems include how GMCs form and evolve, what determines the star formation rate (SFR), and what determines the initial mass function (IMF). Small scales range from dense cores to the protostellar systems they beget. We discuss formation of both low- and high-mass stars, including ongoing accretion. The development of winds and outflows is increasingly well understood, as are the mechanisms governing angular momentum transport in disks. Although outstanding questions remain, the framework is now in place to build a comprehensive theory of star formation that will be tested by the next generation of telescopes.},

abstract = {The main signature of the interaction between cosmic rays and molecular clouds is the high ionisation degree. This decreases towards the densest parts of a cloud, where star formation is expected, because of energy losses and magnetic effects. However recent observations hint to high levels of ionisation in protostellar systems, therefore leading to an apparent contradiction that could be explained by the presence of energetic particles accelerated within young protostars. Our modelling consists of a set of conditions that has to be satisfied in order to have an efficient particle acceleration through the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism. We find that jet shocks can be strong accelerators of protons which can be boosted up to relativistic energies. Another possibly efficient acceleration site is located at protostellar surfaces, where shocks caused by impacting material during the collapse phase are strong enough to accelerate protons. Our results demonstrate the possibility of accelerating particles during the early phase of a proto-Solar-like system and can be used as an argument to support available observations. The existence of an internal source of energetic particles can have a strong and unforeseen impact on the star and planet formation process as well as on the formation of pre-biotic molecules.},

abstract = {Observations of the Ly$\alpha$ forest at z{\~{}}3 reveal an average metallicity Z{\~{}}10-2 Zsolar. The high-redshift supernovae that polluted the intergalactic medium also accelerated relativistic electrons. Since the energy density of the cosmic microwave background is proportional to (1+z)4, at high redshift these electrons cool via inverse Compton scattering. Thus, the first star clusters emit X-rays. Unlike stellar UV ionizing photons, these X-rays can escape easily from their host galaxies. This has a number of important physical consequences:1. Owing to their large mean free path, these X-rays can quickly establish a universal ionizing background and partially reionize the universe in a gradual, homogeneous fashion. If X-rays formed the dominant ionizing background, the universe would have more closely resembled a single-phase medium rather than a two-phase medium.2. X-rays can reheat the universe to higher temperatures than possible with UV radiation.3. X-rays counter the tendency of UV radiation to photodissociate H2, an important coolant in the early universe, by promoting gas-phase H2 formation.The X-ray production efficiency is calibrated to local observations of starburst galaxies, which imply that {\~{}}10{\%} of the supernova energy is converted to X-rays. While direct detection of sources in X-ray emission is difficult, the presence of relativistic electrons at high redshift and thus a minimal level of X-ray emission may be inferred by synchrotron emission observations with the Square Kilometer Array. These sources may constitute a significant fraction of the unresolved hard X-ray background and can account for both the shape and amplitude of the gamma-ray background. This paper discusses the existence and observability of high-redshift X-ray sources, while a companion paper models the detailed reionization physics and chemistry.},

As it exits the loitering phase, the thermodynamic path of the collapsing gas converges to that seen in the absence of any CR background. By the time the gas approaches sink formation densities, the thermodynamic state of the gas is thus remarkably similar across all simulations.

abstract = {In cold dark matter (CDM) cosmogonies, low-mass objects play an important role in the evolution of the universe. Not only are they the first luminous objects to shed light in a previously dark universe, but if their formation is not inhibited by their own feedback, they dominate the galaxy mass function until redshift z{\~{}}5. In this paper we present and discuss the implementation of a three-dimensional cosmological code that includes most of the needed physics to simulate the formation and evolution of the first galaxies with a self-consistent treatment of radiative feedback. The simulation includes continuum radiative transfer using the optically thin variable Eddington tensor (OTVET) approximation and line radiative transfer in the H2 Lyman-Werner bands of the background UV radiation. We include detailed chemistry for H2 formation/destruction, molecular and atomic cooling/heating processes, ionization by secondary electrons, and heating by Ly$\alpha$ resonant scattering. We find that the first galaxies (``small-halo galaxies'') are characterized by bursting star formation, self-regulated by a feedback process that acts on cosmological scales. The mass in stars produced by these objects can exceed the mass in stars produced by normal galaxies; therefore, their impact on cosmic evolution cannot be neglected. The main focus of this paper is on the methodology of the simulations, and we only briefly introduce some of the results. An extensive discussion of the results and the nature of the feedback mechanism are the focus of a companion paper.},

abstract = {We present a new systematic way of setting up galactic gas discs based on the assumption of detailed hydrodynamic equilibrium. To do this, we need to specify the density distribution and the velocity field which supports the disc. We first show that the required circular velocity has no dependence on the height above or below the mid-plane so long as the gas pressure is a function of density only. The assumption of discs being very thin enables us to decouple the vertical structure from the radial direction. Based on that, the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium together with the reduced Poisson equation leads to two sets of second-order non-linear differential equations, which are easily integrated to set up a stable disc. We call one approach `density method' and the other one `potential method'. Gas discs in detailed balance are especially suitable for investigating the onset of the gravitational instability. We revisit the question of global, axisymmetric instability using fully three-dimensional disc simulations. The impact of disc thickness on the disc instability and the formation of spontaneously induced spirals is studied systematically with or without the presence of the stellar potential. In our models, the numerical results show that the threshold value for disc instability is shifted from unity to 0.69 for self-gravitating thick discs and to 0.75 for combined stellar and gas thick discs. The simulations also show that self-induced spirals occur in the correct regions and with the right numbers as predicted by the analytic theory.},

abstract = {Massive stars at redshifts z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 6 are predicted to have played a pivotal role in cosmological reionization as luminous sources of ultraviolet (UV) photons. However, the remnants of these massive stars could be equally important as X-ray-luminous (LX {\~{}} 1038 erg s–1) high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). Because the absorption cross section of neutral hydrogen decreases sharply with photon energy ($\sigma$vpropE –3), X-rays can escape more freely than UV photons from the star-forming regions in which they are produced, allowing HMXBs to make a potentially significant contribution to the ionizing X-ray background during reionization. In this paper, we explore the ionizing power of HMXBs at redshifts z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 6 using a Monte Carlo model for a coeval stellar population of main-sequence stars and HMXBs. Using the archetypal Galactic HMXB Cygnus X-1 as our template, we propose a composite HMXB spectral energy distribution consisting of blackbody and power-law components, whose contributions depend on the accretion state of the system. We determine the time-dependent ionizing power of a combined population of UV-luminous stars and X-ray-luminous HMXBs and deduce fitting formulae for the boost in the population's ionizing power arising from HMXBs; these fits allow for simple implementation of HMXB feedback in numerical simulations. Based on this analysis, we estimate the contribution of high-redshift HMXBs to the present-day soft X-ray background, and we show that it is a factor of {\~{}}100-1000 smaller than the observed limit. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the role of HMXBs in reionization and in high-redshift galaxy formation.},

abstract = {Fragmentation of protostellar discs controls the growth of protostars and plays a key role in determining the final mass of newborn stars. In this paper, we investigate the structure and gravitational stability of the protostellar discs in the full metallicity range between zero and the solar value. Using the mass-accretion rates evaluated from the thermal evolution in the preceding collapse phase of the pre-stellar cores, we calculate disc structures and their evolution in the framework of the standard steady discs. Overall, with higher metallicity, more efficient cooling results in the lower accretion rate and lower temperature inside the disc: at zero metallicity, the accretion rate is [{\~{}}]10-3 M{\{}odot{\}} yr-1 and the disc temperature is [{\~{}}]1000 K, while at solar metallicity, [{\~{}}]10-6 M{\{}odot{\}} yr-1 and [{\~{}}]10 K. Despite the large difference in these values, the zero- and solar-metallicity discs have similar stability properties: the Toomre parameter for the gravitational stability, which can be written using the ratio of temperatures in the disc and in the envelope as QT [{\~{}}] (Tdisc/Tenv)3/2, is {\{}gtrsim{\}} 1, i.e. marginally stable. At intermediate metallicities of 10-5 to 10-3 Z{\{}odot{\}}, however, the discs are found to be strongly unstable with QT [{\~{}}] 0.1-1 since dust cooling, which is effective only in the discs due to their high density ( {\{}gtrsim{\}} 1010 cm- 3), makes the temperature in the discs lower than that in the envelopes. This indicates that masses of the individual stars formed as a result of the protostellar disc fragmentation can be significantly smaller than their parent core in this metallicity range. The typical stellar mass in this case would be a few M{\{}odot{\}}, which is consistent with the observationally suggested mass-scale of extremely metal-poor stars.},

abstract = {Recent observations of z{\~{}}6 quasars and the cosmic microwave background imply a complex history of cosmic reionization. Such a history requires some form of feedback to extend reionization over a long time interval, but the nature of the feedback and how rapidly it operates remain highly uncertain. Here we focus on one aspect of this complexity: which physical processes can cause the global ionized fraction to evolve nonmonotonically with cosmic time? We consider a range of mechanisms and conclude that double reionization is much less likely than a long, but still monotonic, ionization history. We first examine how galactic winds affect the transition from metal-free to normal star formation. Because the transition is actually spatially inhomogeneous and temporally extended, this mechanism cannot be responsible for double reionization, given plausible parameters for the winds. We next consider photoheating, which causes the cosmological Jeans mass to increase in ionized regions and hence suppresses galaxy formation there. In this case, double reionization requires that small halos form stars efficiently, that the suppression from photoheating is strong relative to current expectations, and that ionizing photons are preferentially produced outside previously ionized regions. Finally, we consider H2 photodissociation, in which the buildup of a soft ultraviolet background suppresses star formation in small halos. This can in principle cause the ionized fraction to temporarily decrease, but only during the earliest stages of reionization. Finally, we briefly consider the effects of some of these feedback mechanisms on the topology of reionization.},

abstract = {The first stars in the Universe are predicted to have been much more massive than the Sun. Gravitational condensation, accompanied by cooling of the primordial gas via molecular hydrogen, yields a minimum fragmentation scale of a few hundred solar masses. Numerical simulations indicate that once a gas clump acquires this mass it undergoes a slow, quasi-hydrostatic contraction without further fragmentation; lower-mass stars cannot form. Here we show that as soon as the primordial gas--left over from the Big Bang--is enriched by elements ejected from supernovae to a carbon or oxygen abundance as small as approximately 0.01-0.1 per cent of that found in the Sun, cooling by singly ionized carbon or neutral oxygen can lead to the formation of low-mass stars by allowing cloud fragmentation to smaller clumps. This mechanism naturally accommodates the recent discovery of solar-mass stars with unusually low iron abundances (10(-5.3) solar) but with relatively high (10(-1.3) solar) carbon abundance. The critical abundances that we derive can be used to identify those metal-poor stars in our Galaxy with elemental patterns imprinted by the first supernovae. We also find that the minimum stellar mass at early epochs is partially regulated by the temperature of the cosmic microwave background.},

First, a comprehensive analysis of 87 gas phase reaction rates (both collisional and radiative) relevant in the physical environment of the expanding universe is presented and critically discussed. On this basis, calculations are carried out of the abundance of 21 molecular species as function of redshift, for different values of the cosmological parameters Omega{\_}0 , eta and H{\_}0, evaluating consistently the molecular heating and cooling due to H{\_}2, HD and LiH molecules. One of the major improvements of this work is the use of a better treatment of H recombination that leads to a reduction of a factor 2-3 in the abundance of electrons and H(+) at freeze-out, with respect to previous studies. The lower residual ionization has a negative effect on the chemistry of the primordial gas in which electrons and protons act as catalysts in the formation of the first molecules. We find that in the standard model (h=0.67, eta{\_} {\{}10{\}}=4.5, Omega{\_}0 =1 and [D/H] =4.3x 10(-5) ), the residual fractional ionization at z=1 is [e/H]=3.02x 10(-4) , and the main molecular species fractional abundances [H{\_}2/H]=1.1x 10(-6) , [HD/H{\_}2]=1.1x 10(-3) , [HeH(+/) H]=6.2x 10(-13) , [LiH(+/) H]=9.4x 10(-18) and [LiH/LiH(+]=7.6x) 10(-3) .

Python, a free, cross-platform, general-purpose, high-level programming language, has seen widespread adoption among the scientific community, resulting in the availability of a large number of software packages, from numerical computation (NumPy, SciPy) and machine learning (scikit-learn) to visualization and plotting (matplotlib). SunPy is a data-analysis environment specializing in providing the software necessary to analyse solar and heliospheric data in Python. SunPy is open-source software (BSD licence) and has an open and transparent development workflow that anyone can contribute to. SunPy provides access to solar data through integration with the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO), the Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK), and the HELiophysics Integrated Observatory (HELIO) webservices. It currently supports image data from major solar missions (e.g., SDO, SOHO, STEREO, and IRIS), time-series data from missions such as GOES, SDO/EVE, and PROBA2/LYRA, and radio spectra from e-Callisto and STEREO/SWAVES. We describe SunPy's functionality, provide examples of solar data analysis in SunPy, and show how Python-based solar data-analysis can leverage the many existing tools already available in Python. We discuss the future goals of the project and encourage interested users to become involved in the planning and development of SunPy.},

This implies that clearing of intergalactic H2 occurs before reionization of the universe is complete.

abstract = {The inclusion of rotationally induced mixing in stellar evolution can alter the structure and composition of pre-supernova stars. We survey the effects of progenitor rotation on nucleosynthetic yields in Population III and II supernovae (SNe) using the new adaptive mesh refinement code CASTRO. We examine piston-driven spherical explosions in 15, 25, and 40 M sun stars at Z = 0 and 10-4 Z sun with three explosion energies and two rotation rates. Rotation in the Z = 0 models resulted in primary nitrogen production and a stronger hydrogen burning shell which led all models to die as red supergiants (in contrast to the blue supergiant progenitors made without rotation). On the other hand, the Z = 10-4 Z sun models that included rotation ended their lives as compact blue stars. Because of their extended structure, the hydrodynamics favors more mixing and less fallback in the metal-free stars than the Z = 10-4 models. As expected, higher energy explosions produce more enrichment and less fallback than do lower energy explosions, and at constant explosion energy, less massive stars produce more enrichment and leave behind smaller remnants than do more massive stars. We compare our nucleosynthetic yields to the chemical abundances in the three most iron-poor stars yet found and reproduce the abundance pattern of one, HE 0557-4840, with a zero metallicity, 15 M sun, 2.4 × 1051 erg SN. A Salpeter IMF-averaged integration of our yields for Z = 0 models with explosion energies of 2.4 × 1051 erg or less is in good agreement with the abundances observed in larger samples of extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars, provided 15 M sun stars are included. Since the abundance patterns of EMP stars likely arise from a representative sample of progenitors, our yields suggest that 15-40 M sun core-collapse SNe with moderate explosion energies contributed the bulk of the metals to the early universe.},

Three methods are used to trace IGM properties: (1) the evolution of the Gunn-Peterson (GP) optical depth in the Ly$\alpha$, Ly$\beta$, and Ly$\gamma$ transitions; (2) the distribution of lengths of dark absorption gaps; and (3) the size of H II regions around luminous quasars. Using this large sample, we find that the evolution of the ionization state of the IGM accelerated at z {\textgreater} 5.7: the GP optical depth evolution changes from $\tau$ {\#}{\#}IMG{\#}{\#} [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/132/1/117/img1.gif] {\~{}} (1 + z ) 4.3 to (1 + z ) {\#}{\#}IMG{\#}{\#} [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {\{}gtrsim{\}} 11 , and the average length of dark gaps with $\tau$ {\textgreater} 3.5 increases from 80 comoving Mpc.

The mean length of dark gaps shows the most dramatic increase at z {\~{}} 6, as well as the largest line-of-sight variations. We suggest using dark gap statistics as a powerful probe of the ionization state of the IGM at yet higher redshift. The sizes of H II regions around luminous quasars decrease rapidly toward higher redshift, suggesting that the neutral fraction of the IGM has increased by a factor of {\#}{\#}IMG{\#}{\#} [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {\{}gtrsim{\}} 10 from z = 5.7 to 6.4, consistent with the value derived from the GP optical depth. The mass-averaged neutral fraction is 1{\%}-4{\%} at z {\~{}} 6.2 based on the GP optical depth and H II region size measurements. The observations suggest that z {\~{}} 6 is the end of the overlapping stage of reionization and are inconsistent with a mostly neutral IGM at z {\~{}} 6, as indicated by the finite length of the dark absorption gaps.},

abstract = {I describe the design, implementation, and usage of galpy, a python package for galactic-dynamics calculations. At its core, galpy consists of a general framework for representing galactic potentials both in python and in C (for accelerated computations); galpy functions, objects, and methods can generally take arbitrary combinations of these as arguments. Numerical orbit integration is supported with a variety of Runge-Kutta-type and symplectic integrators. For planar orbits, integration of the phase-space volume is also possible. galpy supports the calculation of action-angle coordinates and orbital frequencies for a given phase-space point for general spherical potentials, using state-of-the-art numerical approximations for axisymmetric potentials, and making use of a recent general approximation for any static potential. A number of different distribution functions (DFs) are also included in the current release; currently, these consist of two-dimensional axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric disk DFs, a three-dimensional disk DF, and a DF framework for tidal streams. I provide several examples to illustrate the use of the code. I present a simple model for the Milky Way's gravitational potential consistent with the latest observations. I also numerically calculate the Oort functions for different tracer populations of stars and compare them to a new analytical approximation. Additionally, I characterize the response of a kinematically warm disk to an elliptical m = 2 perturbation in detail. Overall, galpy consists of about 54,000 lines, including 23,000 lines of code in the module, 11,000 lines of test code, and about 20,000 lines of documentation. The test suite covers 99.6{\%} of the code. galpy is available at http://github.com/jobovy/galpy with extensive documentation available at http://galpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest.},

@article{Chiappinietal2011,
abstract = {The first stars that formed after the Big Bang were probably massive, and they provided the Universe with the first elements heavier than helium ('metals'), which were incorporated into low-mass stars that have survived to the present. Eight stars in the oldest globular cluster in the Galaxy, NGC 6522, were found to have surface abundances consistent with the gas from which they formed being enriched by massive stars (that is, with higher $\alpha$-element/Fe and Eu/Fe ratios than those of the Sun). However, the same stars have anomalously high abundances of Ba and La with respect to Fe, which usually arises through nucleosynthesis in low-mass stars (via the slow-neutron-capture process, or s-process). Recent theory suggests that metal-poor fast-rotating massive stars are able to boost the s-process yields by up to four orders of magnitude, which might provide a solution to this contradiction. Here we report a reanalysis of the earlier spectra, which reveals that Y and Sr are also overabundant with respect to Fe, showing a large scatter similar to that observed in extremely metal-poor stars, whereas C abundances are not enhanced. This pattern is best explained as originating in metal-poor fast-rotating massive stars, which might point to a common property of the first stellar generations and even of the 'first stars'.},

abstract = {Observational identification of the first stars is one of the great challenges in the modern astronomy. Although a single first star is too faint to be detected, supernova explosions of the first stars can be bright enough. An important question is whether such supernovae can be detected in the limited observational area with realistic observational resources. We perform detailed simulations to study the detectability of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) at high redshifts, using the observationally calibrated star formation rate density and supernova occurrence rate. We show that a 100 deg2 survey with the limiting magnitude of 26 mag in near-infrared wavelengths will be able to discover about 10 SLSNe at z {\textgreater} 10. If the survey is extended to 200 deg2 with 27 mag depth, about 10 SLSNe can be discovered at z {\textgreater} 15. We emphasize that the observations at ≥3 $\mu$m are crucial to detect and select SLSNe at z {\textgreater} 10. Our simulations are also applied to the planned survey with Euclid, Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) and Wide-field Imaging Surveyor for High-redshift (WISH). These surveys will be able to detect about 1000, 400 and 3000 SLSNe up to z ˜ 5, 7 and 12, respectively. We conclude that detection of SLSNe at z {\textgreater} 10 is in fact achievable in the near future.},

abstract = {In massive primordial galaxies, the gas may directly collapse and form a single central massive object if cooling is suppressed. H2 line cooling can be suppressed in the presence of a strong soft-ultraviolet radiation field, but the role played by other cooling mechanisms is less clear. In optically thin gas, Ly$\alpha$ cooling can be very effective, maintaining the gas temperature below 104 K over many orders of magnitude in density. However, the large neutral hydrogen column densities present in primordial galaxies render them highly optically thick to Ly$\alpha$ photons. In this paper, we examine in detail the effects of the trapping of these Ly$\alpha$ photons on the thermal and chemical evolution of the gas. We show that despite the high optical depth in the Lyman series lines, cooling is not strongly suppressed, and proceeds via other atomic hydrogen transitions. At densities larger than {\~{}}109 cm-3, collisional dissociation of molecular hydrogen becomes the dominant cooling process and decreases the gas temperature to about 5000 K. The gas temperature evolves with density as T ∝ $\rho$ {\^{}}{\{}$\gamma${\_}eff - 1{\}}, with $\gamma$eff = 0.97-0.98. The evolution is thus very close to isothermal, and so fragmentation is possible, but unlikely to occur during the initial collapse. However, after the formation of a massive central object, we expect that later-infalling, higher angular momentum material will form an accretion disk that may be unstable to fragmentation, which may give rise to star formation with a top-heavy initial mass function.},

abstract = {We consider the physical conditions under which supermassive black holes could have formed inside the first galaxies. Our smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations indicate that metal-free galaxies with a virial temperature of {\~{}}104 K and suppressed H2 formation (due to an intergalactic UV background) tend to form a binary black hole system that contains a substantial fraction ({\textgreater}{\~{}}10{\%}) of the total baryonic mass of the host galaxy. Fragmentation into stars is suppressed without substantial H2 cooling. Our simulations follow the condensation of {\~{}}5×106 Msolar around the two centers of the binary down to a scale of {\textless}{\~{}}0.1 pc. Low-spin galaxies form a single black hole instead. These early black holes lead to quasar activity before the epoch of reionization. Primordial black hole binaries lead to gravitational radiation emission at redshifts z{\textgreater}{\~{}}10 that would be detectable by Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.},

@article{Bromm2006,
abstract = {Detection of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from redshifts z{\textgreater}{\~{}}7 would open a new window into the earliest epoch of cosmic star formation. We construct separate star formation histories at high redshifts for normal (Population I and II) stars and for predominantly massive (Population III) stars. Based on these separate histories, we predict the GRB redshift distribution to be observed by the Swift mission. Regardless of whether Population III progenitors are able to trigger GRBs, we find that a fraction, {\~{}}10{\%}, of all bursts detected by Swift will originate at z{\textgreater}{\~{}}5. This baseline contribution is due to Population I/II star formation, which must have extended out to high redshifts in rare massive galaxies that were enriched by heavy elements earlier than the typical galaxies. In addition, we consider the possible contribution of Population III progenitors to the observable GRB rate. Population III stars are viable progenitors for long-duration GRBs that are triggered by the collapsar mechanism, as long as they can lose their outer envelope through mass transfer to a companion star in a close binary. We find that the likelihood of Population III binaries to satisfy the conditions required by the collapsar mechanism could be enhanced significantly relative to Population I/II binaries. If Population III binaries are common, Swift will be the first observatory to probe Population III star formation at redshifts z{\textgreater}{\~{}}7.},

@article{GalliPadovani2015,
abstract = {Cosmic rays are an important source of heating in the interstellar medium, in particular in dense molecular cloud cores shielded from the external ultraviolet radiation field. The limits placed on the cosmic-ray ionization rate from measurements of the gas temperature in dense clouds are unaffected by the uncertainties associated to the traditional methods based on the analysis of molecular abundances. However, high-resolution data are required to determine with sufficient accuracy the spatial temperature distribution within prestellar cores. In this contribution we illustrate in detail the case of the well-studied prestellar core L1544, showing that both its thermal structure and chemical composition are consistent with a cosmic ray ionization rate of {\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}-17{\}}{\$}{\~{}}s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}, significantly smaller than the value measured in the diffuse interstellar medium. We also briefly discuss possible applications of this method to molecular clouds of other galaxies},

@article{NagakuraOmukai2005,
abstract = {We study the evolution of gas in HII regions around the first stars after the exciting stars end their lives. If the first star in a small halo dies without supernova (SN), subsequent star formation is possible in the same halo. We thus investigate the effect of ionization on subsequent star formation within small haloes in the early Universe using one-dimensional hydrodynamics with spherical symmetry along with non-equilibrium primordial gas chemistry. We find that the enhanced electron fraction facilitates the formation of molecular hydrogen at the cores of these haloes. The low temperature circumstances produced by the H2 cooling is favourable to HD formation and the resultant cooling further drops the temperature below 100K. Consequently, low-mass stars with primordial abundances can form even in a small halo. After accreting the interstellar metals, these stars might resemble low-mass ultra metal-poor stars discovered in the present-day Galactic halo.},

@article{Zackrissonetal2011,
abstract = {The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is expected to revolutionize our understanding of the high-redshift universe, and may be able to test the prediction that the first, chemically pristine (Population III) stars are formed with very high characteristic masses. Since isolated Population III stars are likely to be beyond the reach of JWST, small Population III galaxies may offer the best prospects of directly probing the properties of metal-free stars. Here, we present Yggdrasil, a new spectral synthesis code geared toward the first galaxies. Using this model, we explore the JWST imaging detection limits for Population III galaxies and investigate to what extent such objects may be identified based on their JWST colors. We predict that JWST should be able to detect Population III galaxies with stellar population masses as low as {\~{}}105 M sun at z ≈ 10 in ultra deep exposures. Over limited redshift intervals, it may also be possible to use color criteria to select Population III galaxy candidates for follow-up spectroscopy. The colors of young Population III galaxies dominated by direct starlight can be used to probe the stellar initial mass function (IMF), but this requires almost complete leakage of ionizing photons into the intergalactic medium. The colors of objects dominated by nebular emission show no corresponding IMF sensitivity. We also note that a clean selection of Population III galaxies at z ≈ 7-8 can be achieved by adding two JWST/MIRI filters to the JWST/NIRCam filter sets usually discussed in the context of JWST ultra deep fields.},

abstract = {We study the formation and evolution of H II regions around the first stars formed at redshifts z=10-30. We use a one-dimensional Lagrangian hydrodynamics code that self-consistently incorporates radiative transfer and nonequilibrium primordial gas chemistry. The star-forming region is defined as a spherical dense molecular gas cloud with a Population III star embedded at the center. We explore a large parameter space by considering, as plausible early star-forming sites, dark matter halos of mass Mhalo=105-108 Msolar, gas density profiles with a power-law index w=1.5-2.25, and metal-free stars of mass Mstar=25-500 Msolar. The formation of the H II region is characterized by initial slow expansion of a weak D-type ionization front near the center, followed by rapid propagation of an R-type front throughout the outer gas envelope. We find that the transition between the two front types is indeed a critical condition for the complete ionization of halos of cosmological interest. In small-mass ({\textless}{\~{}}106 Msolar) halos, the transition takes place within a few 105 yr, yielding high escape fractions ({\textgreater}80{\%}) of both ionizing and photodissociating photons. The gas is effectively evacuated by a supersonic shock, with the mean density within the halo decreasing to {\textless}{\~{}}1 cm-3 in a few million years. In larger mass ({\textgreater}{\~{}}107 Msolar) halos, the ionization front remains to be of D-type over the lifetime of the massive star, the H II region is confined well inside the virial radius, and the escape fractions are essentially zero. We derive an analytic formula that reproduces well the results of our simulations for the critical halo mass below which the gas is completely ionized. We discuss immediate implications of the present results for the star formation history and early reionization of the universe.},

abstract = {Recent claims that the strength B IGMF of the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) is {\textgreater}{\~{}} 10-15 G are based on upper limits to the expected cascade flux in the GeV band produced by blazar TeV photons absorbed by the extragalactic background light.
