\subsection{Parallel Batch Processing}
\label{sec:parallel}
Investigating the results of a simulation often requires running an identical analysis on many snapshot in order to study how the system changes with time.  
These operations are typically completely independent, and thus amenable to parallelization---so long as the machine being used has sufficient memory.
To aid in the parallelization of such analyses, \code{gadfly} includes utilities for performing parallel batch processing jobs by making use of python's \code{multiprocessing} module. 

One issue with doing operations such as this in parallel is that they are often IO-bound.
To mitigate the issues that arise when multiple processes attempt to read large amounts of data from disk simultaneously, \code{gadfly}'s parallelization utilities are designed to load the data needed for a given analysis serially in a separate thread from the main execution. 
As the necessary data from each snapshot file is loaded, execution is passed to a pool of worker processes which can then perform the remainder of the analysis in parallel.  An example of such a parallel batch processing script is included in the examples distributed with \code{gadfly}.
