In addition to the core pandas-based analysis framework, \code{gadfly} includes additional functionality for SPH particle rendering and batch processing in a parallel manner.

\subsection{Visualization}
\label{sec:vis}

Highly optimized routine for volume rendering of SPH particles.  Three methods available:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Primary algorithm written in C, parallelized with OpenMP, and wrapped using scipy.weave
\item Secondary algorithm written in pure python, and just-in-time compiled using Numba.
\item Fallback pure python routine.  500X slower than other two.
\end{enumerate}
